New Features in SQL*Plus Release 19c

    mechanism to control product-level security for SQL*Plus. Starting with Oracle
    Database 18c, this mechanism is no longer relevant. This SQL*Plus product-level
    security feature will be unavailable in Oracle Database 19c. Oracle recommends

    predefined variable _SQL_ID.




                                                                                      2
