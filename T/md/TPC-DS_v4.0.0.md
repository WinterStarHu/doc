                       generated by dsdgen, must be treated as NULL values in the data processing system, i.e. the data
                       processing system must be able to retrieve NULL-able columns using 'is null' predicates (FogBugz

0.1   Introduction

         The TPC Benchmark™DS (TPC-DS) is a decision support benchmark that models several generally
         applicable aspects of a decision support system, including queries and data maintenance. The benchmark
         provides a representative evaluation of the System Under Test’s (SUT) performance as a general purpose
         decision support system.

         This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that:

          • Examine large volumes of data;
          • Give answers to real-world business questions;
          • Execute queries of various operational requirements and complexities (e.g., ad-hoc, reporting,
            iterative OLAP, data mining);
          • Are characterized by high CPU and IO load;
          • Are periodically synchronized with source OLTP databases through database maintenance
            functions.
          • Run on “Big Data” solutions, such as RDBMS as well as Hadoop/Spark based systems.

         A benchmark result measures query response time in single user mode, query throughput in multi user
         mode and data maintenance performance for a given hardware, operating system, and data processing
         system configuration under a controlled, complex, multi-user decision support workload.

         Comment: While separated from the main text for readability, comments and appendices are a part of the
         standard and their provisions must be enforced.

0.2   General Implementation Guidelines

         The purpose of TPC benchmarks is to provide relevant, objective performance data to industry users. To
         achieve that purpose, TPC benchmark specifications require benchmark tests be implemented with
         systems, products, technologies and pricing that:

         a)   Are generally available to users;

         b) Are relevant to the market segment that the individual TPC benchmark models or represents (e.g.,
            TPC-DS models and represents complex, high data volume, decision support environments);

         c)   Would plausibly be implemented by a significant number of users in the market segment modeled or
              represented by the benchmark.

         In keeping with these requirements, the TPC-DS database must be implemented using commercially
         available data processing software, and its queries must be executed via SQL interface.

         The use of new systems, products, technologies (hardware or software) and pricing is encouraged so long as
         they meet the requirements above. Specifically prohibited are benchmark systems, products, technologies
         or pricing (hereafter referred to as "implementations") whose primary purpose is performance optimization
         of TPC benchmark results without any corresponding applicability to real-world applications and
         environments. In other words, all "benchmark special" implementations, which improve benchmark results
         but not real-world performance or pricing, are prohibited.
         A number of characteristics shall be evaluated in order to judge whether a particular implementation is a
         benchmark special. It is not required that each point below be met, but that the cumulative weight of the
         evidence be considered to identify an unacceptable implementation. Absolute certainty or certainty beyond
         a reasonable doubt is not required to make a judgment on this complex issue. The question that must be
         answered is: "Based on the available evidence, does the clear preponderance (the greater share or weight) of
         evidence indicate this implementation is a benchmark special?"

         The following characteristics shall be used to judge whether a particular implementation is a benchmark
         special:

          a) Is the implementation generally available, documented, and supported?
          b) Does the implementation have significant restrictions on its use or applicability that limits its use
             beyond TPC benchmarks?
          c) Is the implementation or part of the implementation poorly integrated into the larger product?
          d) Does the implementation take special advantage of the limited nature of TPC benchmarks (e.g., query
             templates, query mix, concurrency and/or contention, etc.) in a manner that would not be generally
             applicable to the environment the benchmark represents?
          e) Is the use of the implementation discouraged by the vendor? (This includes failing to promote the
             implementation in a manner similar to other products and technologies.)
          f) Does the implementation require uncommon sophistication on the part of the end-user, programmer,
             or system administrator?
          g) Is the pricing unusual or non-customary for the vendor or unusual or non-customary compared to
             normal business practices? The following pricing practices are suspect:
                      • Availability of a discount to a small subset of possible customers;
                      • Discounts documented in an unusual or non-customary manner;
                      • Discounts that exceed 25% on small quantities and 50% on large quantities;
                      • Pricing featured as a close-out or one-time special;
                      • Unusual or non-customary restrictions on transferability of product, warranty or
                          maintenance on discounted items.
          h) Is the implementation (including beta-release components) being purchased or used for applications in
             the market segment the benchmark represents? How many sites implemented it? How many end-users
             benefit from it? If the implementation is not currently being purchased or used, is there any evidence
             to indicate that it will be purchased or used by a significant number of end-user sites?

0.3   General Measurement Guidelines

         TPC benchmark results are expected to be accurate representations of system performance. Therefore,
         there are specific guidelines that are expected to be followed when measuring those results. The approach
         or methodology to be used in the measurements are either explicitly described in the specification or left to
         the discretion of the test sponsor.

         When not described in the specification, the methodologies and approaches used must meet the following
         requirements:

          a) The approach is an accepted engineering practice or standard;
          b) The approach does not enhance the result;
          c) Equipment used in measuring the results is calibrated according to established quality standards;
          d) Fidelity and candor is maintained in reporting any anomalies in the results, even if not specified in the
             benchmark requirements.
         Comment: The use of new methodologies and approaches is encouraged as long as they meet the
         requirements outlined above.
0.4    Workload Independence

           TPC-DS uses terminology and metrics which are similar to other benchmarks originated by the TPC and
           others. Such similarity in terminology does not in any way imply that TPC-DS results are comparable to
           other benchmarks. The only benchmark results comparable to TPC-DS are other TPC-DS results compliant
           with the same major revision of the benchmark specification and with the same scale factor.
           While this benchmark offers a rich environment representative of many decision support systems, it does
           not reflect the entire range of decision support requirements. In addition, the extent to which a customer
           can achieve the results reported by a vendor is highly dependent on how closely TPC-DS approximates the
           customer’s application. The relative performance of systems derived from this benchmark does not
           necessarily hold for other workloads or environments. Extrapolations to any other environment are not
           recommended.
           Benchmark results are highly dependent upon workload, specific application requirements, and systems
           design and implementation. As a result of these and other factors, relative system performance will vary.
           Therefore, TPC-DS should not be used as a substitute for a specific customer application benchmarking
           when critical capacity planning and/or product evaluation decisions are contemplated.
           Benchmark sponsors are permitted to employ several possible system designs and a broad degree of
           implementation freedom within the constraints detailed in this specification. A full disclosure report (FDR)
           of the implementation details must be made available along with the reported results.

0.5    Associated Materials

           In addition to this document, TPC-DS relies on material which is only available electronically. While not
           included in the printed version of the specification, this material is integral to the submission of a
           compliant TPC-DS benchmark result. Table 0-1 summarizes the electronic material related to the TPC-DS

                                      1    Business and Benchmark Model

1.1   Overview

         TPC Benchmark™ DS (TPC-DS) contains benchmark components that can be used to assess a broad range
         of system topologies and implementation methodologies in a technically rigorous and directly comparable,
         vendor-neutral manner. In order to ease the learning curve for users and benchmark sponsors who are new
         to TPC-DS, the benchmark has been mapped to a typical business environment. This clause outlines the
         business modeling assumptions that were adopted during the development of the benchmark, and their
         impact on the benchmark environment.

         TPC-DS models the decision support functions of a retail product supplier. The supporting schema
         contains vital business information, such as customer, order, and product data. The benchmark models the
         two most important components of any mature decision support system:

         • User queries, which convert operational facts into business intelligence.
         • Data maintenance, which synchronizes the process of management analysis with the operational
           external data source on which it relies.

         The benchmark abstracts the diversity of operations found in an information analysis application, while
         retaining essential performance characteristics. As it is necessary to execute a great number of queries and
         data transformations to completely manage any business analysis environment, no benchmark can succeed
         in exactly mimicking a particular environment and remain broadly applicable.

         While TPC-DS does not aspire to be a model of how to build an actual information analysis application, the
         workload has been granted a realistic context. It imitates the activity of a multi-channel retailer; thus
         tracking store, web and catalog sales channels.

         The goal of selecting a retail business model is to assist the reader in relating intuitively to the components
         of the benchmark, without tracking that industry segment so tightly as to minimize the relevance of the
         benchmark. The TPC-DS workload may be used to characterize any industry that must transform
         operational and external data into business intelligence.

         Although the emphasis is on information analysis, the benchmark recognizes the need to periodically
         refresh its data. The data represents a reasonable image of a business operation as they progress over time.

         Some TPC benchmarks model the operational aspect of the business environment where transactions are
         executed on a real time basis. Other benchmarks address the simpler, more static model of decision support.
         The TPC-DS benchmark, models the challenges of business intelligence systems where operational data is
         used both to support the making of sound business decisions in near real time and to direct long-range
         planning and exploration.
         Figure 1-1 illustrates TPC-DS benchmark components.

1.2   Business Model

         TPC-DS models any industry that must manage, sell and distribute products (e.g., food, electronics,
         furniture, music and toys etc.). It utilizes the business model of a large retail company having multiple
         stores located nation-wide. Beyond its brick and mortar stores, the company also sells goods through
         catalogs and the Internet. Along with tables to model the associated sales and returns, it includes a simple
         inventory system and a promotion system.

         The following are examples of business processes of this retail company:

          •   Record customer purchases (and track customer returns) from any sales channel
          •   Modify prices according to promotions
          •   Maintain warehouse inventory
          •   Create dynamic web pages
          •   Maintain customer profiles (Customer Relationship Management)

         TPC-DS does not benchmark the operational systems. It is assumed that the channel sub-systems were
         designed at different times by diverse groups having dissimilar functional requirements. It is also
         recognized that they may be operating on significantly different hardware configurations, software
         configurations and data model semantics. All three channel sub-systems are autonomous and retain
         possibly redundant information regarding customers, addresses, etc. For more information in the
         benchmarking of operational system, please see the TPC website (http://www.tpc.org).

         TPC-DS’ modeling of the business environment falls into three broad categories:

          • Data Model and Data Access Assumptions (see Clause 1.3)
            • Query and User Model Assumptions (see Clause 1.4)
            • Data Maintenance Assumptions(see Clause 1.5)

1.3     Data Model and Data Access Assumptions

1.3.1      TPC-DS models a system that allows potentially long running and multi-part queries where the DBA can
           assume that the data processing system is quiescent for queries during any particular period.

1.3.2      The TPC-DS data tracks, possibly with some delay, the state of an operational database through data
           maintenance functions, which include a number of modifications impacting some part of the decision
           support system.

1.3.3      The TPC-DS schema is a snowflake schema. It consists of multiple dimension and fact tables. Each
           dimension has a single column surrogate key. The fact tables join with dimensions using each dimension
           table's surrogate key. The dimension tables can be classified into one of the following types:

            • Static: The contents of the dimension are loaded once during database load and do not change
              over time. The date dimension is an example of a static dimension.
            • Historical: The history of the changes made to the dimension data is maintained by creating
              multiple rows for a single business key value. Each row includes columns indicating the time
              period for which the row is valid. The fact tables are linked to the dimension values that were
              active at the time the fact was recorded, thus maintaining “historical truth”. Item is an example
              of a historical dimension.
            • Non-Historical: The history of the changes made to the dimension data is not maintained. As
              dimension rows are updated, the previous values are overwritten and this information is lost.
              All fact data is associated with the most current value of the dimension. Customer is an example
              of a Non-Historical dimension.

1.3.4      To achieve the optimal compromise between performance and operational consistency, the system
           administrator can set, once and for all, the locking levels and the concurrent scheduling rules for queries
           and data maintenance functions.

1.3.5      The size of a DSS system – more precisely the size of the data captured in a DSS system – may vary from
           company to company and within the same company based on different time frames. Therefore, the TPC-DS
           benchmark will model several different sizes of the DSS (a.k.a. benchmark scaling or scale factor).

1.4     Query and User Model Assumptions

           The users and queries modeled by the benchmark exhibit the following characteristics:

            a) They address complex business problems
            b) They use a variety of access patterns, query phrasings, operators, and answer set constraints
            c) They employ query parameters that change across query executions

           In order to address the enormous range of query types and user behaviors encountered by a decision
           support system, TPC-DS utilizes a generalized query model. This model allows the benchmark to capture
           important aspects of the interactive, iterative nature of on-line analytical processing (OLAP) queries, the
           longer-running complex queries of data mining and knowledge discovery, and the more planned behavior
           of well known report queries.

1.4.1      Query Classes
          The size of the schema and its three sales channels allow for amalgamating the above query classes,
          especially ad-hoc and reporting, into the same benchmark. An ad-hoc querying workload simulates an
          environment in which users connected to the system send individual queries that are not known in
          advance. The system's administrator (DBA) cannot optimize the system specifically for this set of queries.
          Consequently, execution time for those queries can be very long. In contrast, queries in a reporting
          workload are very well known in advance. As a result, the DBA can optimize the system specifically for
          these queries to execute them very rapidly by using clever data placement methods (e.g. partitioning and
          clustering) and auxiliary data structures (e.g. materialized views and indexes). Amalgamating both types of
          queries has been traditionally difficult in benchmark environments since per the definition of a benchmark
          all queries, apart from bind variables, are known in advance. TPC-DS accomplishes this fusion by dividing
          the schema into reporting and ad-hoc parts. The catalog sales channel is dedicated for the reporting part,
          while the store and web channels are dedicated for the ad-hoc part. The catalog sales channel was chosen
          as the reporting part because its data accounts for 40% of the entire data set. The reporting and ad-hoc
          parts of the schema differ in what kind of auxiliary data structures can be created.. The idea behind this
          approach is that the queries accessing the ad-hoc part constitute the ad-hoc query set while the queries
          accessing the reporting part are considered the reporting queries.

          A sophisticated decision support system must support a diverse user population. While there are many
          ways to categorize those diverse users and the queries that they generate, TPC-DS has defined four broad
          classes of queries that characterize most decision support queries:

          •   Reporting queries
          •   Ad hoc queries
          •   Iterative OLAP queries
          •   Data mining queries

          TPC-DS provides a wide variety of queries in the benchmark to emulate these diverse query classes.
1.4.1.1   Reporting Queries

          These queries capture the “reporting” nature of a DSS system. They include queries that are executed
          periodically to answer well-known, pre-defined questions about the financial and operational health of a
          business. Although reporting queries tend to be static, minor changes are common. From one use of a given
          reporting query to the next, a user might choose to shift focus by varying a date range, geographic location
          or a brand name.

1.4.1.2   Ad hoc Queries

          These queries capture the dynamic nature of a DSS system in which impromptu queries are constructed to
          answer immediate and specific business questions. The central difference between ad hoc queries and
          reporting queries is the limited degree of foreknowledge that is available to the System Administrator
          (SysAdmin) when planning for an ad hoc query.
1.4.1.3   Iterative OLAP Queries

          OLAP queries allow for the exploration and analysis of business data to discover new and meaningful
          relationships and trends. While this class of queries is similar to the “Ad hoc Queries” class, it is
          distinguished by a scenario-based user session in which a sequence of queries is submitted. Such a sequence
          may include both complex and simple queries.

1.4.1.4   Data Mining Queries
         Data mining is the process of sifting through large amounts of data to produce data content relationships. It
         can predict future trends and behaviors, allowing businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven
         decisions. This class of queries typically consists of joins and large aggregations that return large data result
         sets for possible extraction.

1.5   Data Maintenance Assumptions

         A data warehouse is only as accurate and current as the operational data on which it is based. Accordingly,
         the migration of data from operational OLTP systems to analytical DSS systems is crucial. The migration
         tends to vary widely from business to business and application to application. Previous benchmarks
         evaluated the data analysis component of decision support systems while excluding a realistic data refresh
         process. TPC-DS offers a more balanced view.

         Decision support database refresh processes usually involve three distinct and important steps:

          • Data Extraction: This phase consists of the accurate extraction of pertinent data from production
            OLTP databases and other relevant data sources. In a production environment, the extraction
            step may include numerous separate extract operations executed against multiple OLTP
            databases and auxiliary data sources. While selection and tuning of the associated systems and
            procedures is important to the success of the production system, it is separate from the purchase
            and configuration of the decision support servers. Accordingly, the data extract step of the ETL
            process (E) is not modeled in the benchmark. The TPC-DS data maintenance process starts from
            generated flat files that are assumed to be the output of this external Extraction process.
          • Data Transformation: This is when the extracted data is cleansed and massaged into a common
            format suitable for assimilation by the decision support database.
          • Data Load: This is the actual insertion, modification and deletion of data within the decision
            support database.

          Taken together, the progression of Extraction, Transformation and Load is more commonly known
          by its acronym, ETL. In TPC-DS, the modeling of Transformation and Load is known as Data
          Maintenance (DM) or Data Refresh. In this specification the two terms are used interchangeably.

         The DM process of TPC-DS includes the following tasks that result from such a complex business
         environment as shown in Figure 1-2:

          i) Load the refresh data set, which consists of new, deleted and changed data destined for the data
             warehouse in its operational format.
         ii) Load refresh data set into the data warehouse applying data transformations, e.g.:
             •   Data denormalization (3rd Normal form to snowflake). During this step the source tables are
                 mapped into the data warehouse by:
                  § Direct source to target mapping. This type of mapping is the most common. It applies to
                       tables in the data warehouse that have an equivalent table in the operational schema.
                  §   Multiple data warehouse source tables are joined and the result is mapped to one target table.
                      This mapping translates the third normal form of the operational schema into the de-
                      normalized form of the data warehouse.
                  §   One source table is mapped to multiple target tables. This mapping is the least common. It
                      occurs if, for efficiency reason, the schema of the operational system is less normalized than
                      the data warehouse schema.
            •    Syntactically cleanse data
             •   De-normalize
        iii) Insert new fact records and delete fact records by date.

the tables that represent the hypothetical operational database in Appendix A.

2.1       Schema Overview

             The TPC-DS schema models the sales and sales returns process for an organization that employs three
             primary sales channels: stores, catalogs, and the Internet. The schema includes seven fact tables:

              • A pair of fact tables focused on the product sales and returns for each of the three channels
              • A single fact table that models inventory for the catalog and internet sales channels.

             In addition, the schema includes 17 dimension tables that are associated with all sales channels. The
             following clauses specify the logical design of each table:

              • The name of the table, along with its abbreviation (listed parenthetically)
              • A logical diagram of each fact table and its related dimension tables
              • The high-level definitions for each table and its relationship to other tables, using the format
                defined in Clause 2.2
              • The scaling and cardinality information for each column

2.2       Column Definitions

2.2.1        Column Name
2.2.1.1      Each column is uniquely named, and each column name begins with the abbreviation of the table in which it
             appears.
2.2.1.2      Columns that are part of the table’s primary key are indicated in the column called Primary Key (Sections 2.3
             and 2.4). If a table uses a composite primary key, then for convenience of reading the order of a given column
             in a table’s primary key is listed in parentheses following the column name.
2.2.1.3      Columns that are part of a business key are indicated with (B) appearing after the column name (Sections 2.3
             and 2.4 ). A business key is neither a primary key nor a foreign key in the context of the data warehouse
             schema. It is only used to differentiate new data from update data of the source tables during the data
             maintenance operations.

2.2.2        Datatype
2.2.2.1      Each column employs one of the following datatypes:
              a) Identifier means that the column shall be able to hold any key value generated for that column.
              b) Integer means that the column shall be able to exactly represent integer values (i.e., values in
                 increments of 1) in the range of at least ( − 2n − 1) to (2n − 1 − 1), where n is 64.
              c) Decimal(d, f) means that the column shall be able to represent decimal values up to and including d
                 digits, of which f shall occur to the right of the decimal place; the values can be either represented
                 exactly or interpreted to be in this range.
              d) Char(N) means that the column shall be able to hold any string of characters of a fixed length of N.
             Comment: If the string that a column of datatype char(N) holds is shorter than N characters, then trailing
             spaces shall be stored in the database or the database shall automatically pad with spaces upon retrieval
             such that a CHAR_LENGTH() function will return N.
              e) Varchar(N) means that the column shall be able to hold any string of characters of a variable length
                 with a maximum length of N. Columns defined as "varchar(N)" may optionally be implemented as
                 "char(N)".
              f) Date means that the column shall be able to express any calendar day between January 1, 1900 and
                 December 31, 2199.
2.2.2.2       The datatypes do not correspond to any specific SQL-standard datatype. The definitions are provided to
              highlight the properties that are required for a particular column. The benchmark implementer may employ any
              internal representation or SQL datatype that meets those requirements.
2.2.2.3       The implementation chosen by the test sponsor for a particular datatype definition shall be applied consistently
              to all the instances of that datatype definition in the schema, except for identifier columns, whose datatype may
              be selected to satisfy database scaling requirements.

2.2.3         NULLs

              If a column definition includes an ‘N’ in the NULLs column this column is populated in every row of the
              table for all scale factors. If the field is blank this column may contain NULLs.

2.2.4         Foreign Key

              If the values in this column join with another column, the foreign columns name is listed in the Foreign
              Key field of the column definition.

2.5       Implementation Requirements

2.5.1        Definition of Terms

2.5.1.1      The tables defined in Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4 are referred to as base tables. The flat file data generated by
             dsdgen corresponding to each base table and loaded into each base table is referred to as base table data. A
             structure containing base table data is referred to as a base table data structure.
2.5.1.2      Other than the base table data structures, any database structure that contains a copy of, reference to, or data
             computed from base table data is defined as an auxiliary data structures (ADS). The data in the ADS is
             materialized from the base table data; references are a form of materialization. There is an essential distinction
             between base table data contained in a base table data structure and data contained in auxiliary data structures.
             Because auxiliary data structures contain copies of, references to, or data computed from base table data,
             deleting data from an auxiliary data structure does not result in the loss of base table data in that it is still
             contained in the base table data structure. In contrast, deleting data from a base table data structure (in the
             absence of copies in any auxiliary data structures) does result in the loss of base table data.
2.5.1.3      There are two types of auxiliary data structures: Implicit and explicit. An explicit auxiliary data structure
             (EADS) is created as a consequence of a directive (e.g. DDL, session options, global configuration parameters).
             These directives are called EADS Directives. Any ADS which is not an EADS is by definition an Implict ADS
             (IADS).
                 Comment:       In contrast to an implicit ADS, an EADS would not have been created without the
                                directive.
2.5.1.4      The assignment of groups of rows from a table or EADS to different files, disks, or areas is defined as
             horizontal partitioning.
2.5.1.5      The assignment of groups of columns of one or more rows to files, disks, or areas different from those storing
             the other columns of these rows is defined as vertical partitioning.
2.5.1.6      A Primary Key is one or more columns that uniquely identifies a row. None of the columns that are part of the
             Primary Key may be nullable. A table must have no more than one Primary Key. A primary key may be
             enforced, e.g. by a primary key constraint.
2.5.1.7    A Foreign Key is a column or combination of columns used to establish a link between the data in two tables.
           A link is created between two tables by adding the column or columns that hold one table's Primary Key values
           to the other table. This column becomes a Foreign Key in the second table. A foreign key may be enforced, e.g.
           by a foreign key constraint.Referential Integrity is a data property whereby a Foreign Key in one table has a
           corresponding Primary key in a different table.
2.5.1.8    The definition of primary and foreign keys is optional.
2.5.1.9    Whenever this specification refers to a set of primary and foreign keys it refers to the set of primary and foreign
           keys defined in clauses 2.3 and 2.4.

2.5.2      Data Processing System & Tables

2.5.2.1    The data processing system shall be implemented using a generally available and supported system (DBMS).
2.5.2.2    The SQL data definition statements and associated scripts used to implement the logical schema definition are
           defined as the DDL.
2.5.2.3    The database which is built and utilized to run the Query Validation test is defined as the qualification
           database.
2.5.2.4    The database which is built and utilized for performance reporting is defined as the test database.
2.5.2.5    The physical clustering of records of different tables within the database is allowed as long as this clustering
           does not alter the logical relationships of each table.
           Comment: The intent of this clause is to permit flexibility in the physical layout of a database and based
           upon the defined TPC-DS schema.
2.5.2.6    Table names should match those provided in Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4. If the data processing system prevents
           the use of the table names specified in Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4, they may be altered provided that:
            • The name changes are minimal (e.g., short prefix or suffix.)
            • The name changes have no performance impact
            • The name changes are also made to the query set, in compliance with Clause 4.2.3
2.5.2.7    Each table listed in Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4, shall be implemented according to the column definitions
           provided above.
2.5.2.8    The column names used in the benchmark implementation shall match those defined for each column specified
           in Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4. If the data processing system prevents the use of the column names specified in
           Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4, they may be altered provided:
            • The name changes are the minimal changes required (e.g., short prefix or suffix or character
               substitution.)
            • The changed names are required to follow the documented naming convention employed in the
               system used for the benchmark implementation
            • The names used must provide no performance benefit compared to any other names that might
               be chosen.
            • The identical name changes must also be made to the query set, in compliance with Clause 4.2.3
2.5.2.9    The columns within a given table may be implemented in any order, but all columns listed in the table definition
           shall be implemented and there shall be no columns added to the tables.
2.5.2.10   Each table column defined in Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4 shall be implemented as discrete columns and shall be
           independently accessible by the data processing system as a single column. Specifically:
            • Columns shall not be merged. For example, C_LOGIN and C_EMAIL_ADDRESS cannot be
               implemented as two sub-parts of a single discrete column C_DATA.
            • Columns shall not be split. For example, P_TYPE cannot be implemented as two discrete columns
               P_TYPE_SUBSTR1 and P_TYPE_SUBSTR2.
2.5.2.11   The database shall allow for insertion of arbitrary data values that conform to the column’s datatype and
           optional constraints defined in accordance with Clause 2.5.4.
2.5.3       Explicit Auxiliary Data Structures (EADS)

2.5.3.1     Except as provided in this section, replication of database objects (i.e., tables, rows or columns) is prohibited.
2.5.3.2     An EADS which does not include data materialized from Catalog_Sales or Catalog_Returns is subject to the
            following limitations:
             • It may materialize data from no more than one base table.
             • It may materialize all or some of the following three items:
                         1. The primary key or any subset of PK columns if the PK is a compound key
                         2. Pointers or references to corresponding base table rows (e.g., “row IDs”).
                         3. At most one of the following:
                                   a) A foreign key or any subset of the FK columns if the FK is a compound key
                                   b) A column having a date data type
                                   c) A column that is a business key
2.5.3.3     An EADS which includes data materialized from Catalog_Sales or Catalog_Returns may not include any data
            materialized from Store_Sales, Store_Returns, Web_Sales, Web_Returns or Inventory.
2.5.3.4     An EADS which materializes data from both fact and dimension tables must be the result of joining on FK – PK
            related columns.
2.5.3.5     An EADS which materializes data from one or more dimension tables without simultaneously materializing
            data from Catalog_Sales and/or Catalog_Returns is disallowed, unless otherwise permitted by Clause 2.5.3.2.
            An EADS which materializes data from one or more dimension tables must materialize at least one dimension
            row for every fact table row, unless the foreign key value for a dimension row is null.
            Comment: The intent is to prohibit the creation of EADS on only dimension tables, except as allowed by
            clause 2.5.3.3.
2.5.3.6     The benchmark implementation of EADS may involve replication of selected data from the base tables
            provided that:
             • All replicated data are managed by the system used for the benchmark implementation
             • All replications are transparent to all data manipulation operations
2.5.3.7     The creation of all EADS must be included in the database load test (see Clause 7.4.3). EADS may not be
            created or deleted during the performance test.
2.5.3.8     Partitioning

2.5.3.8.1   A logical table space is a named collection of physical storage devices referenced as a single, logically
            contiguous, non-divisible entity.

2.5.3.8.2   The DDL may include syntax that directs a table in its entirety to be stored in a particular logical table space.

2.5.3.8.3   Horizontal partitioning of base tables or EADS is allowed. If the partitioning is a function of data in the table
            or auxiliary data structure, the assignment shall be based on the values in the partitioning column(s). Only
            primary keys, foreign keys, date columns and date surrogate keys may be used as partitioning columns. If
            partitioning DDL uses directives that specify explicit partition values for the partitioning columns, they shall
            satisfy the following conditions:
             • They may not rely on any knowledge of the data stored in the partitioning column(s) except the
                 minimum and maximum values for those columns, and the definition of data types for those
                 columns provided in Clause 2.
             • Within the limitations of integer division, they shall define each partition to accept an equal
                 portion of the range between the minimum and maximum values of the partitioning column(s).
             • For date-based partitions, it is permissible to partition into equally sized domains based upon an
                 integer granularity of days, weeks, months, or years; all using the Gregorian calendar (e.g., 30
                 days, 4 weeks, 1 month, 1 year, etc.). For date-based partition granularities other than days, a
                 partition boundary may extend beyond the minimum or maximum boundaries as established in
                 that table’s data characteristics as defined in Clause 3.4
                • The directives shall allow the insertion of values of the partitioning column(s) outside the range
                  covered by the minimum and maximum values, as required by Clause 1.5.

               If any directives or DDL are used to horizontally partition data, the directives, DDL, and other details
               necessary to replicate the partitioning behavior shall be disclosed.

               Multi-level partitioning of base tables or auxiliary data structures is allowed only if each level of
               partitioning satisfies the conditions stated above.

2.5.3.8.4      Vertical partitioning of base tables or EADS is allowed when meeting all of the following requirements:
               • SQL DDL that explicitly partitions data vertically is prohibited.
               • SQL DDL must not contain partitioning directives which influence the physical placement of data
                   on durable media.
               • The row must be logically presented as an atomic set of columns.
               Comment: This implies that vertical partitioning which does not rely upon explicit partitioning directives
               is allowed. Explicit partitioning directives are those that assign groups of columns of one row to files, disks
               or areas different from those storing the other columns in that row.

2.5.4          Constraints

2.5.4.1        The use of both enforced and unenforced constraints is permitted. If constraints are used, they shall satisfy the
               following requirements:
                • Enforced constraints shall be enforced either at the statement level or at the transaction level
                • Unenforced constraints must be validated after all data is loaded during the Load Test and before
                    the start of the Performance Test
                • They are limited to primary key, foreign key, and NOT NULL constraints
                • NOT NULL constraints are allowed on EADSs and tables. Only columns that are marked 'N' in
                    their logical table definition (or columns in EADSs derived from such columns) can be
                    constrained with NOT NULL.

2.5.4.2        If foreign key constraints are defined and enforced, there is no specific requirement for a particular
               delete/update action when enforcing a constraint (e.g., ANSI SQL RESTRICT, CASCADE, NO ACTION, are
               all acceptable).

2.6         Data Access Transparency Requirements

2.6.1          Data Access Transparency is the property of the system that removes from the query text any knowledge of
               the physical location and access mechanisms of partitioned data. No finite series of tests can prove that the
               system supports complete data access transparency. The requirements below describe the minimum
               capabilities needed to establish that the system provides transparent data access. A benchmark
               implementation that uses horizontal partitioning shall meet the requirements for transparent data access
               described in Clauses 2.6.2 and 2.6.3.

               Comment: The intent of this clause is to require that access to physically and/or logically partitioned data
               be provided directly and transparently by services implemented by generally available layers such as the
               interactive SQL interface, the data processing system, the operating system (OS), the hardware, or any
               combination of these.

2.6.2          Each of the tables described in Clause 2.3 and Clause 2.4 shall be identifiable by names that have no
               relationship to the partitioning of tables. All data manipulation operations in the executable query text (see
               Clause 3) shall use only these names.

2.6.3          Using the names which satisfy Clause 2.6.2, any arbitrary non-TPC-DS query shall be able to reference any
               set of rows or columns that is:
• Identifiable by any arbitrary condition supported by the underlying system
• Using the names described in Clause 2.6.2 and using the same data manipulation semantics and
  syntax for all tables

For example, the semantics and syntax used to query an arbitrary set of rows in any one table shall also be
usable when querying another arbitrary set of rows in any other table.

Comment: The intent of this clause is that each TPC-DS query uses general purpose mechanisms to access
data in the database.
                                       3     Scaling and Database Population

           This clause defines the database population and how it scales.

3.1     Scaling Model

3.1.1      The TPC-DS benchmark defines a set of discrete scaling points (“scale factors”) based on the approximate
           size of the raw data produced by dsdgen. The actual byte count may vary depending on individual
           hardware and software platforms.

3.1.2      The set of scale factors defined for TPC-DS is:

            • 1TB, 3TB, 10TB, 30TB, 100TB

           where terabyte (TB) is defined to be 240 bytes.

           Comment: The maximum size of the test database for a valid performance test is currently set at 100TB.
           The TPC recognizes that additional benchmark development work is necessary to allow TPC-DS to scale
           beyond that limit.

3.1.3      Each defined scale factor has an associated value for SF, a unit-less quantity, roughly equivalent to the
           number of gigabytes of data present in the data warehouse. The relationship between scale factors and SF is
           summarized in Table 3-1 Scale Factor and SF.

                                            Table 3-1 Scale Factor and SF

                                      Scale Factor           SF
                                      1TB                    1000
                                      3TB                    3000
                                      10TB                   10000
                                      30TB                   30000
                                      100TB                  100000

3.1.4      Test sponsors may choose any scale factor from the defined series. No other scale factors may be used for a
           TPC-DS result.

3.1.5      Results at the different scale factors are not comparable, due to the substantially different computational
           challenges found at different data volumes.

3.2     Test Database Scaling

3.2.1      Test database is the database used to execute the database load test and the performance test (see Clause
           7.4)

3.2.2      The required row count for each permissible scale factor and each table in the test database is detailed in
           Table 3-2 Database Row Counts.

           Comment: The 1GB entries are used solely for the qualification database (see Clause 3.3.1) and are
           included here for ease of reference.

3.2.3      The row size information provided is an estimate, and may vary from one benchmark submission to
           another depending on the precise data base implementation that is selected. It is provided solely to assist
           benchmark sponsors in the sizing of benchmark configurations.

3.3     Qualification Database Scaling

3.3.1      The Qualification database is the database used to execute the query validation test (see Clause 7.3)

3.3.2      The intent is that the functionality exercised by running the validation queries against the qualification
           database be the same as that exercised against the test database during the performance test. To this end,
           the qualification database must be identical to the test database in virtually every regard (except size),
           including but not limited to:
            a) Column definitions
            b) Method of data generation and loading (but not degree of parallelism)
            c) Statistics gathering method
            d) Data accessibility implementation
            e) Type of partitioning (but not degree of partitioning)
            f) Replication
            g) Table type (if there is a choice)
            h) EADS (e.g., indices)

3.3.3      The qualification database may differ from the test database only if the difference is directly related to the
           difference in sizes. For example, if the test database employs horizontal partitioning (see Clause 2.5.3.7),
           then the qualification database must also employ horizontal partitioning, though the number of partitions
           may differ in each case. As another example, the qualification database could be configured such that it uses
           a representative sub-set of the CPUs, memory and disks used by the test database configuration. If the
           qualification database configuration differs from the test database configuration in any way, the differences
           must be disclosed

3.3.4      The qualification database must be populated using dsdgen, and use a scale factor of 1GB.

3.3.5      The row counts of the qualification database are defined in Clause 3.2.

3.4     dsdgen and Database Population

3.4.1      The test database and the qualification database must be populated with data produced by dsdgen, the
           TPC-supplied data generator for TPC-DS. The major and minor version number of dsdgen must match that
           of the TPC-DS specification. The source code for dsdgen is provided as part of the electronically
           downloadable portion of this specification (see Appendix F).

3.4.2      The data generated by dsdgen are meant to be compliant with Table 3-2 and Table 5-2. In case of
           differences between the table and the data generated by dsdgen, dsdgen prevails.

3.4.3      Vendors are allowed to modify the dsdgen code for both the initial database population and the data
           maintenance. However, the resultant data must meet the following requirements in order to be considered
           correct:

            a) The content of individual columns must be identical to that produced by dsdgen.
            b) The data format of individual columns must be identical to that produced by dsdgen.
            c) The number of rows generated for a given scale factor must be identical to that specified in Table 3-2
               and Table 5-2.

           If a modified version of dsdgen is used, the modified source code must be disclosed in full. In addition, the
           auditor must verify that the modified source code which is disclosed matches the data generation program
           used in the benchmark execution.

           Comment: The intent of this clause is to allow for modification of the dsdgen code required for portability
           or speed, while precluding any change that affects the resulting data. Minor changes for portability or bugs
           are permitted in dsdgen for both initial database population and data maintenance.

3.4.4      If modifications are restricted to a subset of the source code, the vendor may publish only the individual
           dsdgen source code files which have been modified.
3.4.5      The output of dsdgen is text. The content of each field is terminated by '|'. A '|' in the first position of a row
           indicates that the first column of the row is empty. Two consecutive '|' indicate that the given column
           value is empty. Empty column values are only generated for columns that are NULL-able as specified in
           the logical database design. Empty column values, as generated by dsdgen, must be treated as NULL values
           in the data processing system, i.e. the data processing system must be able to retrieve NULL-able columns
           using 'is null' predicates.
           Comment: The data generated by dsdgen includes some international characters. Examples of international
           characters are Ô and É. The database must preserve these characters during loading and processing by using a
           character encoding such as ISO/IEC 8859-1 that includes these characters.

3.5     Data Validation

           The test database must be verified for correct data content. This must be done after the initial database load
           and prior to any performance tests. A validation data set is produced using dsdgen with the “-validate”
           and “-vcount” options. The minimum value for “-vcount” is 50, which produces 50 rows of validation data
           for most tables. The exceptions being the “returns” fact tables which will only have 5 rows each on average
           and the dimension tables with fewer than 50 total rows.

           All rows produced in the validation data set must exist in the test database.
                                          4     Query Overview

4.1       General Requirements and Definitions for Queries

4.1.1        Query Definition and Availability

4.1.1.1      Each query is described by the following components:
              a) A business question, which illustrates the business context in which the query could be used. The
                 business questions are listed in Appendix B.
              b) The functional query definition, as specified in the TPC-supplied query template (see Clause 4.1.2 for a
                 discussion of Functional Query Definitions)
              c) The substitution parameters, which describe the substitution values needed to generate the executable
                 query text
              d) The answer set, which is used in query validation (see Clause 7.3)
Comment: Some functional query definitions include a limit on the number of rows to be returned by the query. These
         limits are omitted from the business question.
Comment: In cases where the business question does not accurately describe the functional query definition, the latter will
         prevail.
Comment: Queries are designed to test various aspects of a typical data warehouse system. This includes the query
         optimizer’s ability to transform any valid SQL queries as they may be written by humans or tools into their
         most optimal form. Hence, the TPC-DS provided query templates may include unnecessary or non-optimal SQL
         structures
4.1.1.2      Due to the large size of the TPC-DS query set, this document does not contain all of the query components.
             Refer to Table 0-1 Electronically Available Specification Material for information on obtaining the query set.

4.1.2        Functional Query Definitions

4.1.2.1      The functionality of each query is defined by its query template and dsqgen.

4.1.3        dsqgen translates the query templates into fully functional SQL, which is known as executable query text
             (EQT). The major and minor version number of dsqgen must match that of the TPC-DS specification. The
             source code for dsqgen is provided as part of the electronically downloadable portion of this specification
             (see Table 0-1 Electronically Available Specification Material).
4.1.3.1      The query templates are primarily phrased in compliance with SQL1999 core (with OLAP amendments). A
             template includes the following, non-standard additions:
              • They are annotated, where necessary, to specify the number of rows to be returned
              • They include substitution tags that, in conjunction with dsqgen, allow a single template to
                 generate a large number of syntactically distinct queries, which are functionally equivalent
4.1.3.2      The executable query text for each query in a compliant implementation must be taken from either the
             functional query definition or an approved query variant (see Clause Appendix C). Except as specifically
             allowed in Clauses 4.2.3, Error! Reference source not found.4.2.4 and 4.2.5, executable query text must be
             used in full, exactly as provided by the TPC.
4.1.3.3      Any query template whose EQT does not match the functionality of the corresponding EQT produced by the
             TPC-supplied template is invalid.
4.1.3.4      All query templates and their substitution parameters shall be disclosed.
4.1.3.5      Benchmark sponsors are allowed to alter the precise phrasing of a query template to allow for minor differences
             in product functionality or query dialect as defined in Clause 4.2.3.
4.1.3.6      If the alterations allowed by Clause 4.2.3 are not sufficient to permit a benchmark sponsor to produce EQT that
             can be executed by the DBMS selected for their benchmark submission, they may submit an alternate query
             template for approval by the TPC (see Clause 4.2.3.4).
4.1.3.7      If the query template used in a benchmark submission is not identical to a template supplied by the TPC, it must
             satisfy the compliance requirements of Clauses 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.2.5.

4.2       Query Modification Methods

4.2.1        The queries must be expressed in a commercially available implementation of the SQL language. Since the
             ISO SQL language is continually evolving, the TPC-DS benchmark specification permits certain deviations
             from the SQL phrasing used in the TPC-supplied query templates.

4.2.2        There are four types of permissible deviations:

              a) Minor query modifications, defined in Clause 4.2.3
              b) Modifications to limit row counts, defined in clause 4.2.4
              c) Modifications for extraction queries, defined in clause 4.2.5
              d) Approved query variants, defined in Appendix C

4.2.3        Minor Query Modifications
4.2.3.1      It is recognized that implementations require specific adjustments for their operating environment and the
             syntactic variations of its dialect of the SQL language. The query modifications described in Clause 4.2.3.4:
              • Are defined to be minor
              • Do not require approval
              • May be used in conjunction with any other minor query modifications
              • May only be used to modify a functional query definition or its approved variants

             Modifications that do not fall within the bounds described in Clause 4.2.3.4 are not minor and are not
             compliant unless they are an integral part of an approved query variant (see Appendix C).

             Comment: The only exception is for the queries that require a given number of rows to be returned. The
             requirements governing this exception are given in Clause 4.2.4.1
             Comment: Bullet 4 in above list prevents applying minor query modifications to generated sql text
4.2.3.2      The application of minor query modifications to functional query definitions or approved variants must be
             consistent over the functional query set or their approved variants. For example, if a particular vendor-specific
             date expression or table name syntax is used in one query, it must be used in all other queries involving date
             expressions or table names. The following query modifications are exempt from this requirement: e5, f2, f6,
             f10, g2 and g3.
4.2.3.3      The use of minor modifications shall be disclosed and justified (see Clause 10.3.4.4).
4.2.3.4      The following query modifications are minor:

            a) Tables:

                1. Table names - The table and view names found in the CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, DROP
                   VIEW and FROM clause of each query may be modified to reflect the customary naming
                   conventions of the system under test.
                2. Tablespace references - CREATE TABLE statements may be augmented with a tablespace reference
                   conforming to the requirements of Clause 3.
                3. WITH() clause - Queries using the "with()" syntax, also known as common table sub-expressions,
                        can be replaced with semantically equivalent derived tables or views.

            b) Joins:

                1. Outer Join - For outer join queries, vendor specific syntax may be used instead of the specified
                        syntax. For example, the join expression "CUSTOMER LEFT OUTER JOIN ORDERS ON
       C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY" may be replaced by adding CUSTOMER and ORDERS to the from
       clause and adding a specially-marked join predicate (e.g., C_CUSTKEY *= O_CUSTKEY).
    2. Inner Join - For inner join queries, vendor specific syntax may be used instead of the specified
       syntax. For example, the join expression "FROM CUSTOMER, ORDERS WHERE C_CUSTKEY =
       O_CUSTKEY" may be modified to use a JOIN clause such as "FROM CUSTOMER JOIN ORDERS
       ON C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY".

c) Operators:

    1.      Explicit ASC - ASC may be explicitly appended to columns in an ORDER BY clause.
    2.      Relational operators - Relational operators used in queries such as "<", ">", "<>", "<=", and "=", may
            be replaced by equivalent vendor-specific operators, for example ".LT.", ".GT.", "!=" or "^=", ".LE.",
            and "==", respectively.
    3.      String concatenation operator - For queries which use string concatenation operators, vendor
            specific syntax can be used (e.g. || can be substituted with +).
    4.      Rollup operator - an operator of the form "rollup (x,y)" may be substituted with the following
            operator: "x,y with rollup". x,y are expressions.
d) Control statements:

    1. Command delimiters - Additional syntax may be inserted at the end of the executable query text for
            the purpose of signaling the end of the query and requesting its execution. Examples of such
            command delimiters are a semicolon or the word "GO".
    2. Transaction control statements - A CREATE/DROP TABLE or CREATE/DROP VIEW statement
       may be followed by a COMMIT WORK statement or an equivalent vendor-specific transaction
       control statement.
    3. Dependent views - If an implementation is using variants involving views and the implementation
       only supports “DROP RESTRICT” semantics (i.e., all dependent objects must be dropped first), then
       additional DROP statements for the dependent views may be added.

e) Alias:

    1. Select-list expression aliases - For queries that include the definition of an alias for a SELECT-list
       item (e.g., "AS" clause), vendor-specific syntax may be used instead of the specified syntax.
       Examples of acceptable implementations include "TITLE <string>", or "WITH HEADING <string>".
       Use of a select-list expression alias is optional.
    2. GROUP BY and ORDER BY - For queries that utilize a view, nested table-expression, or select-list
       alias solely for the purposes of grouping or ordering on an expression, vendors may replace the
       view, nested table-expression or select-list alias with a vendor-specific SQL extension to the
       GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause. Examples of acceptable implementations include "GROUP BY
       <ordinal>", "GROUP BY <expression>", "ORDER BY <ordinal>", and "ORDER BY <expression>".
    3. Correlation names - Table-name aliases may be added to the executable query text. The keyword
       "AS" before the table-name alias may be omitted.
    4. Nested table-expression aliasing - For queries involving nested table-expressions, the nested
       keyword "AS" before the table alias may be omitted.
    5. Column alias - column name alias may be added for columns in any SELECT list of an executable
            query text. These column aliases may be used to refer to the column in later portions of the query,
            such as GROUP BY or ORDER BY clauses.

f) Expressions and functions:
   1. Date expressions - For queries that include an expression involving manipulation of dates (e.g.,
      adding/subtracting days/months/years, or extracting years from dates), vendor-specific syntax may
      be used instead of the specified syntax. Examples of acceptable implementations include
      "YEAR(<column>)" to extract the year from a date column or "DATE(<date>) + 3 MONTHS" to add
      3 months to a date.
   2. Output formatting functions - Scalar functions whose sole purpose is to affect output formatting
      (such as treatment of null strings) or intermediate arithmetic result precision (such as COALESCE
      or CAST) may be applied to items in the outermost SELECT list of the query.
   3. Aggregate functions - At large scale factors, the aggregates may exceed the range of the values
        supported by an integer. The aggregate functions AVG and COUNT may be replaced with
        equivalent vendor-specific functions to handle the expanded range of values (e.g., AVG_BIG and
        COUNT_BIG).
   4. Substring Scalar Functions - For queries which use the SUBSTRING() scalar function, vendor-
      specific syntax may be used instead of the specified syntax. For example, "SUBSTRING(S_ZIP, 1,
      5)".
   5. Standard Deviation Function - For queries which use the standard deviation function
      (stddev_samp), vendor specific syntax may be used (e.g. stdev, stddev).
   6. Explicit Casting - Scalar functions (such as CAST) whose sole purpose is to affect result precision for
      operations involving integer columns or values may be applied. The resulting syntax must have
      equivalent semantic behavior.
   7. Mathematical functions - Vendors specific mathematical expressions may be used to implement
        mathematical functions in the executable query text. The replacement syntax must implement the
        full semantic behavior (e.g. handling for NULLs) of the mathematical functions as defined in the
        ISO SQL standard. For example, avg() may be replaced by average() or by a mathematical
        expressions such as sum()/count().
   8. Date casting - Explicit casting of columns that are of the date datatype, as defined in Clause 2.2.2,
        and date constant strings, expressed in month, day and year, into a datatype that allows for date
        arithmetic in expressions is permissible. Replacement syntax must have equivalent semantic
        behavior.
   9. Casting syntax: - Vendor specific casting syntax may be used to implement casting functions
       present in the executable query text provided that the vendor specific casting syntax is semantically
       equivalent to the syntax provided in the executable query text.
   10. Existing scalar functions - Existing scalar functions (such as CAST) in the query templates whose
       sole purpose is to affect output formatting or result precision may be modified. The resulting
       syntax must be consistent with the query template's original intended semantic behavior.
Comment: At higher scale factors some of the existing scalar functions might need adjustments to enable the
benchmark to be run successfully at the intended scale factor. For example, to avoid numeric overflow at the
intended scale factor, changing the CAST of a column from decimal(15, 4) to wider decimal(31, 4) is allowed."
g) General
   1.   Delimited identifiers - In cases where identifier names conflict with reserved words in a given
        implementation, delimited identifiers may be used.
   2.   Parentheses - Adding or removing parentheses around expressions and sub-queries is allowed. Both
        an opening parenthesis '(' and its corresponding closing parenthesis ')' must be added or removed
        together.
   3.   Ordinals - Ordinals can be exchanged with the referenced column name, or vice versa. E.g. "select
        a,b from T order by 2;" can be rewritten to "select a,b from T order by b;".
          Comment: The application of all minor query modifications must result in queries that have equivalent
          ISO SQL semantic behavior as the queries generated from the TPC-supplied functional query definitions or
          their approved variants.
          Comment: All query modifications are labeled minor based on the assumption that they do not
          significantly impact the performance of the queries


4.2.4     Row Limit Modifications
4.2.4.1   Some queries require that a given number of rows be returned (e.g., “Return the first 10 selected rows”). If N is
          the number of rows to be returned, the query must return exactly the first N rows unless fewer than N rows
          qualify, in which case all rows must be returned. There are four permissible ways of satisfying this requirement:
           • Vendor-specific control statements supported by a test sponsor’s interactive SQL interface may
               be used (e.g., SET ROWCOUNT n) to limit the number of rows returned.
           • Control statements recognized by the implementation specific layer (see Clause 8.2.4) and used to
               control a loop which fetches the rows may be used to limit the number of rows returned (e.g.,
               while rowcount <= n).
           • Vendor-specific SQL syntax may be added to the SELECT statement of a query template to limit
               the number of rows returned (e.g., SELECT FIRST n). This syntax is not classified as a minor
               query modification since it completes the functional requirements of the functional query
               definition and there is no standardized syntax defined. In all other respects, the query must
               satisfy the requirements of Clause 4.1.2. The syntax added must deal solely with the size of the
               answer set, and must not make any additional explicit reference, for example, to tables, indices,
               or access paths.
           • Enclosing the outer most SQL statement (or statements in case of iterative OLAP queries) with a
               select clause and a row limiting predicate. For example, if Q is the original query text. Then the
               modification would be: SELECT * FROM (Q) where rownum<=n. This syntax is not classified as
               a minor query modification since it completes the functional requirements of the functional query
               definition and there is no standardized syntax defined. In all other respects, the query must
               satisfy the requirements of Clause 4.1.2. The syntax added must deal solely with the size of the
               answer set, and must not make any additional explicit reference, for example, to tables, indices,
               or access paths.

          A test sponsor must select one of these methods and use it consistently for all the queries that require that a
          specified number of rows be returned.

4.2.5     Extract Query Modifications

4.2.5.1   Some queries return large result sets. These queries correspond to the queries described in Clause 1.4 as those
          that produce large result sets for extraction; the results are to be saved for later analysis. The benchmark allows
          for alternative methods for a DBMS to extract these result rows to files in addition to the normal method of
          processing them through a SQL front-end tool and using the front-end tool to output the rows to a file. If a
          query for any stream returns 10,000 or more result rows, the vendor may extract the rows for that query in all
          streams to files using one of the following permitted vendor-specific extraction tools or methods:
          • Vendor-specific SQL syntax may be added to the SELECT statement of a query template to redirect the
            rows returned to a file. For example, “Unload to file ‘outputfile’ Select c1, c2 …”

          • Vendor-specific control statements supported by a test sponsor’s interactive SQL interface may be used.
            For example,
          set output_file = ‘outputfile’
          select c1, c2…;
          unset output_file;

          • Control statements recognized by the implementation specific layer (see Clause 8.2.4) and used to
            invoke an extraction tool or method.
4.2.5.2   If one of these alternative extract options is used, the output shall be formatted as delimited or fixed-width
          ASCII text.
4.2.5.3   If one of these alternative extract options is used, they must meet the following conditions:

          A test sponsor may select only one of the options in 4.2.5.1. That method must be used consistently for all
          the queries that are eligible as extract queries.

          • If the extraction syntax modifies the query SQL, in all other respects the query must satisfy the
            requirements of Clause 4.1.2. The syntax added must deal solely with the extraction tool or
            method, and must not make any additional explicit reference, for example, to tables, indices, or
            access paths.
          • The test sponsor must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Auditor that the file names used, and
            the extract facility itself, does not provide hints or optimizations in the DBMS such that the query
            has additional performance gains beyond any benefits from accelerating the extraction of rows.

          The tool or method used must meet all ACID requirements for the queries used in combination with the
          tool or method.

4.2.6     Query Variants

4.2.6.1   A Query Variant is an alternate query template, which has been created to allow a vendor to overcome specific
          functional barriers or product deficiencies that could not be address by minor query modifications.
4.2.6.2   Approval of any new query variant is required prior to using such variant to produce compliant TPC-DS results.
          The approval process is defined Clause 4.2.7.
4.2.6.3   Query variants that have already been approved are summarized in Appendix C.
          Comment: Since the soft appendix is updated each time a new variant is approved, test sponsors should
          obtain the latest version of this appendix prior to implementing the benchmark. See Appendix F Tool Set
          Requirements for more information)

4.2.7     Query Variant Approval
4.2.7.1   New query variants will be considered for approval if they meet one of the following criteria:
          a) The vendor requesting the variant cannot successfully run the executable query text against the
             qualification database using the functional query definition or an approved variant even when applying
             appropriate minor query modifications to the functional query definition or an approved variant as per
             Clause 4.2.3.
          b) The proposed variant contains new or enhanced SQL syntax, relevant to the benchmark, which is
             defined in an Approved Committee Draft of a new ISO SQL standard.
          c) The variant contains syntax that brings the proposed variant closer to adherence to an ISO SQL
             standard.
          d) The proposed variant contains minor syntax differences that have a straightforward mapping to ISO
             SQL syntax used in the functional query definition and offers functionality substantially similar to the
             ISO SQL standard.
4.2.7.2   To be approved, a proposed variant should have the following properties. Not all of the properties are
          specifically required. Rather, the cumulative weight of each property satisfied by the proposed variant will be
          the determining factor in approving the variant.
           a) Variant is syntactic only, seeking functional compatibility and not performance gain.
           b) Variant is minimal and restricted to correcting a missing functionality.
           c) Variant is based on knowledge of the business question rather than on knowledge of the system under
               test (SUT) or knowledge of specific data values in the test database.
           d) Variant has broad applicability among different vendors.
           e) Variant is non procedural.
           f) Variant is an approved ISO SQL syntax to implement the functional query definition.
           g) Variant is sponsored by a vendor who can implement it and who intends on using it in an upcoming
               implementation of the benchmark.
4.2.7.3   To be approved, the proposed variant shall conform to the implementation guidelines defined in Clause 4.2.8
          and the coding standards defined in Clause 4.2.9.
4.2.7.4   Approval of proposed query variants will be at the sole discretion of the TPC-DS subcommittee, subject to TPC
          policy.
4.2.7.5   All proposed query variants that are submitted for approval will be recorded, along with a rationale describing
          why they were or were not approved.

4.2.8     Variant Implementation Guidelines
4.2.8.1   When a proposed query variant includes the creation of a table, the datatypes shall conform to Clause 2.2.2.
4.2.8.2   When a proposed query variant includes the creation of a new entity (e.g., cursor, view, or table) the entity
          name shall ensure that newly created entities do not interfere with other query sessions and are not shared
          between multiple query sessions.
4.2.8.3   Any entity created within a proposed query variant must also be deleted within that variant.
4.2.8.4   If CREATE TABLE statements are used within a proposed query variant, they may include a tablespace
          reference (e.g., IN <tablespacename>). A single tablespace must be used for all tables created within a proposed
          query variant.

4.2.9     Coding Style
4.2.9.1   Implementers may code the executable query text in any desired coding style, including
           a) use of line breaks, tabs or white space
           b) choice of upper or lower case text
4.2.9.2   The coding style used shall have no impact on the performance of the system under test, and must be
          consistently applied throughout the entire query set.
          Comment: The auditor may require proof that the coding style does not affect performance.
  4.3   Substitution Parameter Generation
4.3.1   Each query has one or more substitution parameters. Dsqgen must be used to generate executable query texts
        for the query streams. In order to generate the required number of query streams, dsqgen must be used with
        the RNGSEED, INPUT and STREAMS options. The value for the RNGSEED option, <SEED>, is selected as the
        timestamp of the end of the database load time (Load End Time) expressed in the format mmddhhmmsss as
        defined in Clause 7.4.3.8. The value for the STREAMS option, <S>, is two times the number of streams, Sq, to be
        executed during each Throughput Test (S=2* Sq). The value of the INPUT option, <input.txt>, is a file containing
        the location of all 99 query templates in numerical order.

        Comment:          RNGSEED guarantees that the query substitution parameter values are not known prior to
        running the power and throughput tests. Called with a value of <S> for the STREAMS parameter, dsqgen
        generates S+1 files, named query_0.sql through query_[S].sql. Each file contains a different permutation of the
        99 queries.

4.3.2   Query_0.sql is the sequence of queries to be executed during the Power Test; files query_1.sql through
        query_[Sq].sql are the sequences of queries to be executed during the first Throughput Test; and files
        query_[Sq+1].sql through query_[2*Sq].sql are the sequences of queries to be executed during the second
        Throughput Test.

            Comment: The substitution parameter values for the qualification queries are provided in 18Appendix B:.
            They must be manually inserted into the query templates.
                                        5    Data Maintenance

5.1     Implementation Requirements and Definitions

5.1.1      Data maintenance operations are performed as part of the benchmark execution. These operations consist of
           processing data maintenance functions, grouped into refresh runs.The total number of refresh runs in the
           benchmark equals the number of query streams in one Throughput Test. Each refresh run has its own refresh
           data set as generated by dsdgen and must be used in the order generated by dsdgen. Data maintenance
           operations execute separately from queries. Refresh runs do not overlap; at most one refresh run is running at
           any time.

5.1.2      Each refresh run includes all data maintenance functions defined in Clause 5.3 on the refresh data set
           defined in Clause 5.2. All data maintenance functions need to have finished in refresh run n before any
           data maintenance function can commence in refresh run n+1 (see Clause 7.4.8.6).

5.1.3      Data maintenance functions can be decomposed or combined into any number of database operations and
           the execution order of the data maintenance functions can be freely chosen as long as the following
           conditions are met. Particularly, the functions in each refresh run may be run sequentially or in parallel.

            a) Data Accessibility properties (See Clause 6.1 );
            b) All primary/foreign key relationships must be preserved regardless of whether they have been enforced
               by constraint (see Clause 2.5.4). This does not imply that referential integrity constraints must be
               defined explicitly.
            c) A time-stamped output message is sent when the data maintenance process is finished.
            d) All delete DM operations finish before any insert DM function begin.
           Comment: The intent of this clause is to maintain primary and foreign key referential integrity.
           Comment: Implementers can assume that if all DM operations complete successfully that the PK/FK
           relationship is preserved. Any exceptions are bugs that need to be fixed in the spec.

5.1.4      All existing and enabled EADS affected by any data maintenance operation must be updated within those
           data maintenance operations. All updates performed by the refresh process must be visible to queries that
           start after the updates are completed.

5.1.5      The data maintenance functions must be implemented in SQL or procedural SQL. The proper
           implementation of the data maintenance function must be validated by the auditor who may request
           additional tests to ascertain that the data maintenance functions were implemented and executed in
           accordance with the benchmark requirements.

           Comment: Procedural SQL can be SQL embedded in other programs, interpreted or compiled.
           Comment: If the views in Clasue 5.3.11 are used the TPC-DS benchmark specification permits certain
           deviations from the SQL phrasing used in the TPC-supplied views. Any changes must adhere to the Minor
           query modifications, defined in Clause 4.2.3

5.1.6      The staging area is an optional collection of database objects (e.g. tables, indexes, views, etc.) used to
           implement the data maintenance functions. Database objects created in the staging area can only be used
           during execution of the data maintenance phase and cannot be used during any other phase of the
           benchmark. Any object created in the staging area needs to be disclosed in the FDR.

5.1.7      Any disk storage used for the staging area must be priced. Any mapping or virtualization of disk storage
           must be disclosed.
5.2      Refresh Data

5.2.1         The refresh data consists of a series of refresh data sets, numbered 1, 2, 3…n. <n> is identical to the
              number of streams used in the Throughput Tests of the benchmark. Each refresh data set consists of <N>
              flat files. The content of the flat files can be used to populate the source schema, defined in Appendix A.
              However, populating the source schema is not mandated. The flat files generated for each refresh data set
              and their corresponding source schema tables are denoted in the following table.

5.2.2    The number of rows present in each refresh set at scale factor 1 for each of the flat files is summarized in
         Table 5-1.

5.2.3    The refresh data set of each data maintenance function must be generated using dsdgen. The execution of
         dsdgen is not timed. The output of dsdgen is a text file. The storage to hold the refresh data sets must be
         part of the priced configuration.

5.2.4    The refresh data set produced by dsdgen can be modified in the following way: The output file for each
         table of the refresh data set can be split into n files where each file contains approximately 1/n of the total
         number of rows of the original output file. The order of the rows in the original output file must be
         preserved, such that the concatenation of all n files is identical to the original file.




        2 The number of rows are approximate numbers.

        3 The number of bytes can vary from refresh set to refresh set due to NULL values.
5.2.5         The refresh data set for a specific refresh run must be loaded and timed as part of the execution of the
              refresh run. The loading of refresh data sets must be performed via generic processes inherent to the data
              processing system or by the loader utility the database software provides and supports for general data
              loading. It is explicitly prohibited to use a loader tool that has been specifically developed for TPC-DS.

5.2.6         The refresh data set generated by dsdgen must be stored in flat files at a location which is different from the
              Database Location.

5.2.7         If a staging area is used, loading the refresh data set in the staging area is a timed portion of the data
              maintenance process.

5.3      Data Maintenance Functions

5.3.1         Data maintenance functions perform insert and delete operations that are defined in pseudo code.
              Depending on which operation they perform and on which type of table, they are categorized as Method1
              through Method3. They are:

              Method 1: fact insert data maintenance

5.3.3         Data maintenance function method 1 reads rows from a view V (see column View Name of table in Clause
              5.3.2) and insert rows into a data warehouse table T. Both V and T are defined as part of the data
              maintenance function. T is created as part of the initial load of the data warehouse. V is a logical table that
              does not need to be instantiated.

5.3.5         (intentionally left blank)
5.3.6      (intentionally left blank)

5.3.7      Method 1: Fact Table Load
           In the following pseudo code, view V refers to one of the views in Clause 5.3.11 as follows: ssv for
           store_sales, wsv for web_sales and csv for catalog_sales.
           for every row v in view V corresponding to sales fact table F
               insert v into F;

5.3.8      Method 2: Sales and Returns Fact Table Delete
           Delete rows from R with corresponding rows in S
                  where d_date between Date1 and Date2
           Delete rows from S
                  where d_date between Date1 and Date2

           Comment: D_date is a column of the date_dim dimension. D_date has to be obtained by joining to the
           date_dim dimension on sales date surrogate key. The sales date surrogate key for the store sales is
           ss_sold_date_sk, for catalog it is cs_sold_date_sk and for web sales it is ws_sold_date_sk.

5.3.9      Method 3: Inventory Fact Table Delete
           Delete rows from I where d_date between Date1 and Date2

           Comment: D_date is a column of the date_dim dimension. D_date has to be obtained by joining to the
           date_dim dimension on inv_date_sk.

5.3.10     Each data maintenance function inserting or updating rows in dimension and fact tables is defined by the
           following components:

           a) Descriptor, indicating the name of the data maintenance function in the form of DM_<abbreviation of
              data warehouse table> for dimensions and LF_<abbreviation of the data warehouse fact table> for fact
              tables. The extension indicates the data warehouse table that is populated with this data maintenance
              function.
           b) The data maintenance method describes the pseudo code of the data maintenance function.
           c) A SQL view V describing which tables of the source schema need to be joined to obtain the correct
              rows to be loaded.
           d) The column mapping defining which source schema columns map to which data warehouse columns;

5.3.11     Each data maintenance function deleting rows from fact tables is defined by the following components:

           a) Descriptor, indicating the name of the data maintenance function in the form of DF_<abbreviation of
              data warehouse fact table>. The extension indicates the data warehouse fact table from which rows are
              deleted.
           b) Tables: S and R, or I in case of inventory
           c) Two dates: Date1 and Date2
           d) The data maintenance method indicates how data is deleted
               Comment:        In the flat files generated by dsdgen for data maintenance there are 2 files which relate
                              to deletes. One flat file (delete_<n>.dat) associated with deletes applies to sales and
                              returns for store, web and catalog where <n> denotes the set number, defined in Clause
                              5.1.2). The second flat file (inventory_delete_<n>.dat) applies to inventory only where
                              <n> denotes the set number,d efined in Clause 5.1.2). In each delete flat file there are 3
                              sets of start and end dates for the delete function. Each of the 3 sets of dates must be
                              applied.

                                         6     Data Accessibility Properties

6.1         The Data Accessibility Properties

            The System Under Test must be configured to satisfy the requirements for Data Accessibility described in this
            clause. Data Accessibility is demonstrated by the SUT being able to maintain operations with full data access
            during and after the permanent irrecoverable failure of any single Durable Medium containing tables, EADS, or
            metadata. Data Accessibility tests are conducted by inducing failure of a Durable Medium within the SUT.

6.1.1       Definition of Terms
6.1.1.1     Data Accessibility: The ability to maintain operations with full data access after the permanent irrecoverable
            failure of any single Durable Medium containing tables, EADS, or metadata.
6.1.1.2     Durable Medium: A data storage medium that is either:
            a. An inherently non-volatile medium (e.g., magnetic disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, solid state disk,
                persistent memory, etc.) or;
            b. A volatile medium with its own self-contained power supply that will retain and permit the transfer of data,
                before any data is lost, to an inherently non-volatile medium after the failure of external power.
            Comment: A configured and priced Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is not considered external power.
            Comment: Memory can be considered a durable medium if it can preserve data long enough to satisfy the
            requirement (b) above. For example, if memory is accompanied by an Uninterruptible Power Supply, and the
            contents of memory can be transferred to an inherently non-volatile medium during the failure, then the
            memory is considered durable. Note that no distinction is made between main memory and memory performing
            similar permanent or temporary data storage in other parts of the system (e.g., disk controller caches).
6.1.1.3     Metadata: Descriptive information about the database including names and definitions of tables, indexes, and
            other schema objects. Various terms commonly used to refer collectively to the metadata include metastore,
            information schema, data dictionary, or system catalog.
6.1.2       Data Accessibility Requirements
6.1.2.1     TPC-DS’ Data Accessibility Requirements are met if the SUT continues executing queries and data
            maintenance functions with full data access during and after the permanent irrecoverable failure of any single
            durable medium containing TPC-DS database objects, e.g. tables, EADS, or metadata.
6.1.2.2     The test sponsor may satisfy that the system meets the Data Accessibility Requirements laid out in Clause
            6.1.2.1 by performing either a Data Accessibility Test or by providing Data Accessibility Documentation.
6.1.2.3     Data Accessibility Test
6.1.2.4     The Data Accessibility Test is performed by causing the failure of a Durable Media during the execution of the
            first Data Maintenance Test (described in Clause 7.4). The durable media is determined by the auditor at
            random. The number of durable media to be failed are:
             • One if all data resides in one set of durable media or
             • One per distinct set of durable media, if multiple distinct sets of durable media are used for
                  different purposes, e.g. metadata, primary data copies, EADs, and one in the intersecting set of
                  durable media, if overlapping sets of durable media are used for different purposes, e.g.
                  metadata, primary data copies, EADs.
             The Data Accessibility Test is successful if all in-flight data maintenance functions, subsequent
             queries and data maintenance functions complete successfully after the above durable media have
             failed.
            Comment: This clause could effectively require multiple simultaneous points of failure and the
            implementation must be able to successfully complete the DA test as describe above.

6.1.2.4.1   The Data Accessibility Test must be performed as part of the Performance Test that is used as the basis for
            reporting the performance metric and results, while running against the test database at the full reported scale
            factor.
6.1.2.5     Data Accessibility Documentation

6.1.2.5.1   The Data Accessibility Documentation must fulfill all of the following requirements:
             • The Data Accessibility Documentation must be publically available on the vendor’s website,
             • The FDR must include sufficient documentation to prove that the Data Accessibility
                requirements are met as a stand alone documentation.
                        • The FDR must include a link to the Data Accessibility Documentation from the
                            vendor’s website,
                        • The FDR must include quotes from the relevant content of the Data Accessibility
                            Documentation.
             • The Data Accessibility Documentation must cover all products and services priced in the SUT
                which are involved in meeting the Data Accessibility Requirements laid out in Clause 6.1.2.1,
             • The Data Accessibility Documentations must describe how data redundancy is accomplished
                withhin the SUT. Following are some examples of such description:
                        • Data Objects are stored on redundant devices (e.g. RAID 1, RAID 5)
                        • Data Objects are redundantly stored on multiple storage devices in the same facility.
                        • Data Objects are redundantly stored across multiple facilities.
                        • Data Objects are redundantly stored across data centers in multiple regions.
             • The following features must be supported by the SUT and described in the Data Accessibility
                Documentation:
                        • Synchronous writes: The redundant writes of multiple copies of Data Objects to
                            multiple storage devices are executed synchronously.
                        • Automatic repair: Any loss of redundancy of a Data Object is automatically repaired
                            without any operator intervention.
                                         7    Performance Metrics and Execution Rules

7.1      Definition of Terms

7.1.1       The Benchmark is defined as the execution of the Load Test followed by the Performance Test.

7.1.2       The Load Test is defined as all activity required to bring the System Under Test to the configuration that
            immediately precedes the beginning of the Performance Test. The Load Test must not include the
            execution of any of the queries in the Power Test or Throughput Test or any similar query.

7.1.3       The Performance Test is defined as the Power Test, both Throughput Tests and both Data Maintenance
            Tests.

7.1.4       A query stream is defined as the sequential execution of a permutation of queries submitted by a single
            emulated user. A query stream consists of the 99 queries defined in Clause 4.

7.1.5       A session is defined as a uniquely identified process context capable of supporting the execution of user-
            initiated database activity.

7.1.6       A query session is a session executing activity on behalf of a Power Test or a Throughput Test.

7.1.7       A refresh run is defined as the execution of one set of data maintenance functions.

7.1.8       A refresh session is a session executing activity on behalf of a refresh run.

7.1.9       A Throughput Test consists of Sq query sessions each running a single query stream.

7.1.10      A Power Test consists of exactly one query session running a single query stream.

7.1.11      A Data Maintenance Test consists of the execution of a series of refresh streams .

7.1.12      A query is an ordered set of one or more valid SQL statements resulting from applying the required
            parameter substitutions to a given query template. The order of the SQL statements is defined in the query
            template.

7.1.13      The SUT consists of a collection of configured components used to complete the benchmark.

7.1.14      The mechanism used to submit queries to the SUT and to measure their execution time is called a driver.

7.1.15      A timestamp must be taken in the time zone the SUT is located in. It is defined as any representation
            equivalent to yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.s, where:

             •   yyyy is the 4 digit representation of year
             •   mm is the 2 digit representation of month
             •   dd is the 2 digit representation of day
             •   hh is the 2 digit representation of hour in 24-hour clock notation
             •   mm is the 2 digit representation of minute
             •   ss.s is the 3 digit representation of second with a precision of at least 1/10 of a second

7.1.16      Elapsed time is measured in seconds rounded up to the nearest 0.1 second.

7.1.17      Test Database is the loaded data and created meta data required to execute the TPC-DS benchmark, i.e.
            Load test, Power test, Throughput test, Data maintenance test and all tests required by the auditor.

7.1.18      Database Location is the location of loaded data that is directly accessible (read/write) by the test
            database to query or apply dml operations on the TPC-DS tables defined in Clause 2 as required by
            Load test, Power test, Throughput test, Data maintenance test and all tests required by the auditor.
7.2       Configuration Rules

7.2.1        The driver is a logical entity that can be implemented using one or more physical programs, processes, or
             systems (see Clause 8.3).

7.2.2        The communication between the driver and the SUT must be limited to one session per query. These
             sessions are prohibited from communicating with one another except for the purpose of scheduling Data
             Maintenance functions (see Clause 5.3).

7.2.3        All query sessions must be initialized in exactly the same way. All refresh sessions must be initialized in
             exactly the same way. The initialization of a refresh session may be different than that of the query session.

7.2.4        All session initialization parameters, settings and commands must be disclosed.

             Comment: The intent of this clause is to provide the information needed to precisely recreate the
             execution environment of any given stream as it exists prior to the submission of the first query or data
             maintenance function.

7.2.5        The driver shall submit each TPC-DS query for execution by the SUT via the session associated with the
             corresponding query stream.

7.2.6        In the case of the data maintenance functions, the driver is only required to submit the commands
             necessary to cause the execution of each data maintenance function.

7.2.7        The driver's submittal of the queries to the SUT during the performance test shall be limited to the
             transmission of the query text to the data processing system and whatever additional information is
             required to conform to the measurement and data gathering requirements defined in this document. In
             addition:

              • The interaction between the driver and the SUT shall not have the purpose of indicating to the
                SUT or any of its components an execution strategy or priority that is time-dependent or query-
                specific;
              • The interaction between the driver and the SUT shall not have the purpose of indicating to the
                SUT, or to any of its components, the insertion of time delays;
              • The driver shall not insert time delays before, after, or between the submission of queries to the
                SUT;
              • The interaction between the driver and the SUT shall not have the purpose of modifying the
                behavior or configuration of the SUT (i.e., data processing system or operating system settings)
                on a query-by-query basis. These parameters shall not be altered during the execution of the
                performance test.
             Comment: One intent of this clause is to prohibit the pacing of query submission by the driver.

7.2.8        Environmental Assumptions
7.2.8.1      The configuration and initialization of the SUT, the database, or the session, including any relevant parameter,
             switch or option settings, shall be based only on externally documented capabilities of the system that can be
             reasonably interpreted as useful for a decision support workload. This workload is characterized by:
              • Sequential scans of large amounts of data;
              • Aggregation of large amounts of data;
              • Multi-table joins;
              • Possibly extensive sorting.
7.2.8.2    While the configuration and initialization can reflect the general nature of this expected workload, it shall not
           take special advantage of the limited functions actually exercised by the benchmark. The queries actually
           chosen in the benchmark are merely examples of the types of queries that might be used in such an
           environment, not necessarily actual user queries. Due to this limit in the scope of the queries and test
           environment, TPC-DS has chosen to restrict the use of some database technologies (see Clause 2.5). In general,
           the effect of the configuration on benchmark performance should be representative of its expected effect on the
           performance of the class of applications modeled by the benchmark.
7.2.8.3    The features, switches or parameter settings that comprise the configuration of the operating system, the data
           processing system or the session must be such that it would be reasonable to expect a database administrator
           with the following characteristics be able to decide to use them:
            • Knowledge of the general characteristics of the workload as defined above;
            • Knowledge of the logical and physical database layout;
            • Access to operating system and database documentation;
            • No knowledge of product internals beyond what is documented externally.

           Each feature, switch or parameter setting used in the configuration and initialization of the operating
           system, the data processing system or the session must meet the following criteria:

           • It shall remain in effect without change throughout the performance test;
           • It shall not make reference to specific tables, indices or queries for the purpose of providing hints
             to the query optimizer.

7.2.9      The collection of statistics requested through the use of directives must be part of the database load. If these
           directives request the collection of different levels of statistics for different columns, they must adhere to
           the following rules.:
           1) The level of statistics collected for a given column must be based on the column’s membership in a class.
           2) Class definitions must rely solely on the following column attributes from the logical database design (as
              defined in Clause 2):
               • Datatype;
               • Nullable;
               • Foreign Key;
               • Primary Key.
           3) Class definitions may combine column attributes using AND, OR and NOT operators. (for example, one
              class could contain all columns satisfying the following combination of attributes: [Identifier Datatype]
              AND [NOT nullable OR Foreign Key]);
           4) Class membership must be applied consistently on all columns across all tables;
           5) Statistics that operate in sets, such as distribution statistics, should employ a fixed set appropriate to the
              scale factor used. Knowledge of the cardinality, values or distribution of a non-key column (as specified in
              Clause 3) must not be used to tailor statistics gathering.

7.2.10     Profile-Directed Optimization
7.2.10.1   Special rules apply to the use of so-called profile-directed optimization (PDO), in which binary executables are
           reordered or otherwise optimized to best suit the needs of a particular workload. These rules do not apply to the
           routine use of PDO by a database vendor in the course of building commercially available and supported
           database products; such use is not restricted. Rather, the rules apply to the use of PDO by a test sponsor to
           optimize executables of a database product for a particular workload. Such optimization is permissible if all of
           the following conditions are satisfied:
            • The use of PDO or similar procedures by the test sponsor must be disclosed.
            • The procedure and any scripts used to perform the optimization must be disclosed.
            • The procedure used by the test sponsor could reasonably be used by a customer on a shipped
                database executable.
            • The optimized database executables resulting from the application of the procedure must be
                supported by the database software vendor.
            • The workload used to drive the optimization is described in Clause 7.2.10.2.
               • The same set of executables must be used for all phases of the benchmark.
7.2.10.2      If profile-directed optimization is used, the workload used to drive it can be the execution of any subset of the
              TPC-DS queries or any data maintenance functions, in any order, against a TPC-DS database of any desired
              scale factor, with default substitution parameters applied. The query/data maintenance function set, used in
              PDO, must be reported.

7.3        Query and Query Output Validation

7.3.1         Query template n (1<=n<=99) used in a benchmark submission must match template n (or any variant of
              template n) of the TPC-DS specification, subject to query template modification rules in Clause 4.2.

7.3.2         The query templates (potentially after applying modification rules in Clause 4.2) used to generate the
              qualification queries must be identical to the query templates used to generate the queries for the Power
              and Throughput Tests.

7.3.3         The query output validation process is defined as follows:

               1. Populate the qualification database (see Clause 3.3) ;
               2. Create a set of qualification queries by generating executable query text for all 99 queries using query
                  templates with the qualification substitution parameters as defined in Appendix B (see Clause 4.3);
               3. Execute all qualification queries and capture their result (qualification query result data);
               4. Compare the qualification query result data to the reference answer sets defined for the queries (see
                  Clause 7.3.4).
Comment: The reference answer set is provided as part of the TPC-DS benchmark specification.

7.3.4         Comparing answer sets
7.3.4.1       Each qualification query result data must match exactly one of the reference answer sets for that query in the
              following way:
                  •    A random sample of n distinct rows (n>=3) of the qualification query result data must match n distinct
                       rows in the reference answer set, subject to the constraints defined in Clause 7.5. For answer sets with
                       less than 4 rows, all rows must match, subject to the constraints defined in Clause 7.5.
                  •    The position of all n rows being compared must be identical between the qualification query result data
                       and the reference answer set, unless position differences can be explained by implementation specific
                       NULL ordering or the query does not specify an order for its qualification query result data.
Comment:         TPC-DS allows for position differences between the output data and answer sets because the SQL standard
allows for implementation specific NULL ordering.

7.4        Execution Rules

7.4.1         General Requirements

7.4.1.1       If the load test, power test, either throughput test, or either data maintenance test fail, the benchmark run is
              invalid.
7.4.1.2       All tables created with explicit directives during the execution of the benchmark tests must meet the data
              accessibility requirements defined in Clause 6.
7.4.1.3       The SUT, including any database server(s), shall not be restarted at any time after the power test begins until
              after all tests have completed.
7.4.1.4       The driver shall submit queries through one or more sessions on the SUT. Each session corresponds to one, and
              only one, query stream on the SUT.
7.4.1.5   Parallel activity within the SUT directed toward the execution of a single query or data maintenance function
          (e.g. intra-query parallelism) is not restricted.
7.4.1.6   The real-time clock used by the driver to compute the timing intervals must measure time with a resolution of at
          least 0.01 second.

7.4.2     The benchmark must use the following sequence of tests:

          a) Database Load Test
          b) Power Test
          c) Throughput Test 1
          d) Data Maintenance Test 1
          e) Throughput Test 2
          f) Data Maintenance Test 2

7.4.3     Database Load Test
7.4.3.1   The process of building the test database is known as database load. Database load consists of timed and un-
          timed components.
7.4.3.2   The population of the test database, as defined in Clause 2.1, consists of two logical phases:
           a) Generation: the process of using dsdgen to create data in a format suitable for presentation to the load
              facility. The generated data may be stored in memory, or in flat files on tape or disk.
           b) Loading: the process of storing the generated data to the Database Location.
          Generation and loading of the data can be accomplished in two ways:
          a) Load from flat files: dsdgen is used to generate flat files that are stored in or copied to a location on
             the SUT or on external storage, which is different from the Database Location, i.e. this data is a copy of
             the TPC-DS data. The records in these files may optionally be permuted and relocated to the SUT or
             external storage. Before benchmark execution data must be loaded from these flat files into the
             Database Location. In this case, only the loading into the Database Location contributes to the database
             load time.
          b) In-line load: dsdgen is used to generate data that is directly loaded into the Database Location using an
             "in-line" load facility. In this case, generation and loading occur concurrently and both contribute to
             the database load time.
          Comment: For option a) The TPC-DS data stored in the Database Location must be a full copy of the flat
          files. I.e. if the flat files were deleted the benchmark could be executed. The reason for this is that the storing of
          dsdgen data into the Database Location must result in a new copy of the data, i.e. logical copying is not allowed.
7.4.3.3   The resources used to generate, permute, relocate to the SUT or hold dsdgen data may optionally be distinct
          from those used to run the actual benchmark. For example:
           a) For load from flat files, a separate system or a distinct storage subsystem may be used to generate, store
              and permute dsdgen data into the flat files used for the database load.
           b) For in-line load, separate and distinct processing elements may be used to generate and permute data
              and to deliver it to the Database Location.
7.4.3.4   Resources used only in the generation phase of the population of the test database must be treated as follows:

          For load from flat files,

          a) Any processing element (e.g., CPU or memory) used exclusively to generate and hold dsdgen data or
             relocate it to the SUT prior to the load phase shall not be included in the total priced system and shall
             be physically removed from or made inaccessible to the SUT prior to the start of the Load Testusing
             vendor supported methods;
            b) Any storage facility (e.g., disk drive, tape drive or peripheral controller) used exclusively to generate
               and deliver data to the SUT during the load phase shall not be included in the total priced system. The
               test sponsor must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the auditor that this facility is not being used in the
               Performance Tests.

            For in-line load, any processing element (e.g., CPU or memory) or storage facility (e.g., disk drive, tape
            drive or peripheral controller) used exclusively to generate and deliver dsdgen data to the SUT during the
            load phase shall not be included in the total priced system and shall be physically removed from or made
            inaccessible to the SUT prior to the start of the Performance Tests.

            Comment: The intent is to isolate the cost of resources required to generate data from those required to
            load data into the Database Location.
7.4.3.5     An implementation may require additional programs to transfer dsdgen data into the database tables (from
            either flat file or in-line load). If non-commercial programs are used for this purpose, their source code must be
            disclosed. If commercially available programs are used for this purpose, their vendors and configurations shall
            be disclosed. Whether or not the software is commercially available, use of the software's functionality's shall
            be limited to:
             1. Permutation of the data generated by dsdgen ;
             2. Delivery of the data generated by dsdgen to the data processing system.
7.4.3.6     The database load must be implemented using commercially available utilities (invoked at the command level
            or through an API) or an SQL programming interface (such as embedded SQL or ODBC).
7.4.3.7     Database Load Time

7.4.3.7.1   The elapsed time to prepare the Test Database for the execution of the performance test is called the Database
            Load Time (TLOAD), and must be disclosed. It includes all of the elapsed time to create the tables defined in
            Clause 2.1, load data, create and populate EADS, define and validate constraints, gather statistics for the test
            database, configure the system under test to execute the performance test, and to ensure that the test database
            meets the data accessibility requirements including syncing loaded data on RAID devices and the taking of a
            backup of the data processing system, when necessary.
7.4.3.8     The Database Load Time, known as TLOAD is the difference between Load Start Time and Load End Time.
             • Load Start Time is defined as the timestamp taken at the start of the creation of the tables defined
                in Clause 2.1 or when the first character is read from any of the flat files or, in case of in-line load,
                when the first character is generated by dsdgen, whichever happens first
             • Load End Time is defined as the timestamp taken when the Test Database is fully populated, all
                EADS are created, a database backup has completed (if applicable) and the SUT is configured, as
                it will be during the performance test
            Comment: Since the time of the end of the database load is used to seed the random number generator for
            the substitution parameters, that time cannot be delayed in any way that would make it predictable to the
            test sponsor.

7.4.3.8.1   There are five classes of operations which may be excluded from database load time:
            a) Any operation that does not affect the state of the data processing system (e.g., data generation into flat
               files, relocation of flat files to the SUT, permutation of data in flat files, operating-system-level disk
               partitioning or configuration);
            b) Any modification to the state of the data processing system that is not specific to the TPC-DS workload
               (e.g. logical tablespace creation or database block formatting);
            c) The time required to install or remove physical resources (e.g. CPU, memory or disk) on the SUT that
               are not priced;
                d) An optional backup of the test database performed at the test sponsor’s discretion. However, if a
                   backup is required to ensure that the data accessibility properties can be met, it must be included in the
                   load time;
                e) Operations that create RAID devices.
                f) Tests required to fulfill data validation test (see Clause 3.5)
                g) Tests required to fulfill the audit requirements (see Clause 11)

7.4.3.8.2      There cannot be any manual intervention during the Database Load.

7.4.3.8.3      The SUT or any component of it must not be restarted after the start of the Load Test and before the start of the
               Performance Test.
               Comment: The intent of this Clause is that when the timing ends the system under test be capable of
               executing the Performance Test without any further change. The database load may be decomposed into
               several phases. Database load time is the sum of the elapsed times of all phases during which activity other
               than that detailed in Clause 7.4.3.8.1 occurred on the SUT.


7.4.4          Power Test

7.4.4.1        The Power Test is executed immediately following the load test.
7.4.4.2        The Power Test measures the ability of the system to process a sequence of queries in the least amount of time
               in a single stream fashion.
7.4.4.3        The Power Test shall execute queries submitted by the driver through a single query stream with stream
               identification number 0 and using a single session on the SUT.
7.4.4.4        The queries in the Power Test shall be executed in the order assigned to its stream identification number and
               defined in 18Appendix D:.
7.4.4.5        Only one query shall be active at any point of time during the Power Test.
7.4.4.6
7.4.5       Power Test Timing

7.4.5.1        The elapsed time of the Power Test, known as TPower is the difference between
                • Power Test Start Time, which is the timestamp that must be taken before the first character of the
                   executable query text of the first query of Stream 0 is submitted to the SUT by the driver; and
                • Power Test End Time, which is the timestamp that must be taken after the last character of output
                   data from the last query of Stream 0 is received by the driver from the SUT.
                • The elapsed time of the Power Test shall be disclosed.

7.4.6          Throughput Tests
7.4.6.1        The Throughput Tests measure the ability of the system to process the most queries in the least amount of time
               with multiple users.
7.4.6.2        Throughput Test 1 immediately follows the Power Test. Throughput Test 2 immediately follows Data
               Maintenance Test 1.
7.4.6.3        Any explicitly created aggregates, as defined in Clause 5.1.4, present and enabled during any portion of
               Throughput Test 1or 2 must be present and enabled at all times that queries are being processed.
7.4.6.4        Each query stream contains a distinct permutation of the query templates defined for TPC-DS. The permutation
               of queries for the first 20 query streams is shown in 18Appendix D:.
7.4.6.5        Only one query shall be active on any of the sessions at any point of time during a Throughput Test.
7.4.6.6    The Throughput Test shall execute queries submitted by the driver through a sponsor-selected number of query
           streams (Sq). There must be one session per query stream on the SUT and each stream must execute queries
           serially (i.e. one after another).
7.4.6.7    Each query stream is uniquely identified by a stream identification number s ranging from 1 to S, where S is
           the number of query streams in the Throughput Tests (Throughput Test 1 plus Throughput Test 2).
7.4.6.8    Once a stream identification number has been generated and assigned to a given query stream, the same number
           must be used for that query stream for the duration of the test.
7.4.6.9    The value of Sq is any even number larger than or equal to 4.
7.4.6.10   The same value of Sq shall be used for bothThroughput Tests, and shall remain constant throughout each
           Throughput Test.
7.4.6.11   The queries in each query stream shall be executed in the order assigned to the stream identification number and
           defined in 18Appendix D:.

7.4.7      Throughput Test Timing

7.4.7.1    For a given query template t, used to produce the ith query within query stream s, the query elapsed time,
           QD(s, i, t), is the difference between:
            • The timestamp when the first character of the executable query text is submitted to the SUT by
               the driver;
            • The timestamp when the last character of the output is returned from the SUT to the driver and a
               success message is sent to the driver.
           Comment: All the operations that are part of the execution of a query (e.g., creation and deletion of a
           temporary table or a view) must be included in the elapsed time of that query.
7.4.7.2    The elapsed time of each query in each stream shall be disclosed for each Throughput Test and Power Test.
7.4.7.3    The elapsed time of Throughput Test 1, known as TTT1 is the difference between Throughput Test 1 Start Time
           and Throughput Test 1 End Time.
7.4.7.4    Throughput Test 1 Start Time, which is the timestamp that must be taken before the first character of the
           executable query text of the first query stream of Throughput Test 1 is submitted to the SUT by the driver.
7.4.7.5    Throughput Test 1 End Time, which is the timestamp that must be taken after the last character of output data
           from the last query of the last query stream of Throughput Test 1 is received by the driver from the SUT.
           Comment: In this clause a query stream is said to be first if it starts submitting queries before any other
           query streams. The last query stream is defined to be that query stream whose output data are received last
           by the driver.
7.4.7.6    The elapsed time of Throughput Test 2, known as TTT2 is the difference between Throughput Test 2 Start Time
           and Throughput Test 2 End Time,
7.4.7.7    Throughput Test 2 Start Time is defined as a timestamp identical to Data Maintenance Test 1 End Time.
7.4.7.8    Throughput Test 2 End Time, which is the timestamp that must be taken after the last character of output data
           from the last query of the last query stream of Throughput Test 2 is received by the driver from the SUT.
7.4.7.9    The elapsed time of each Throughput Test shall be disclosed.

7.4.8      Data Maintenance Tests
7.4.8.1    The Data Maintenance Tests measure the ability to perform desired data changes to the TPC-DS data set.
7.4.8.2    Data Maintenance Test 1 immediately follows Throughput Test 1 and Data Maintenance Test 2 immediately
           follows Throughput Test 2.
7.4.8.3    Each Data Maintenance Test shall execute Sq/2 refresh runs.
7.4.8.4      Each refresh run uses its own refresh data set as generated by dsdgen. Refresh runs must be executed using
             refresh data sets in the order generated by dsdgen.
7.4.8.5      Any explicitly created aggregates, as defined in clause 5.1.4, present and enabled during any portion of
             Throughput Test 1 must conform to clause 7.4.6.3.
7.4.8.6      Refresh runs do not overlap; at most one refresh run is running at any time. All data maintenance functions
             need to have finished in refresh run n before any data maintenance function can commence on refresh run n+1.
7.4.8.7      The scheduling of each data maintenance function within refresh runs is left to the test sponsor.
7.4.8.8      The Durable Medium failure required as part of the Data Accessibility Test (Clause 6.1.2) must be triggered
             during Data Maintenance Test 1 (at some time after the starting timestamp of the first refresh run in Data
             Maintenance Test 1, and before the ending timestamp of the last refresh run in Data Maintenance Test 2).

7.4.9        Data Maintenance Timing
7.4.9.1      The elapsed time DI(i,s), for the data maintenance function i executing in refresh run s is the difference
             between:
              • The timestamp, DS(i,s), when the first character of the data maintenance function is submitted to
                 the SUT by the driver, or when the first character requesting the execution of data maintenance
                 function is submitted to the SUT by the driver or when the first character of the refresh data set
                 used by the data maintenance function is read from a location other than the Database Location,
                 whichever happens first; and
              • The timestamp, DE(i,s), when the last character of output data from the data maintenance
                 function is received by the driver from the SUT and a success message has been received by the
                 driver from the SUT.
7.4.9.2     The elapsed time, DI(s), for the execution of all data maintenance functions of refresh run s, is the difference
            between:
          • The start timestamp, DS(s), of refresh run s, defined as DS(i,s) for the first data maintenance function i
            executed as part of refresh run s; and
          • The end timestamp, DE(s), of refresh run s, defined as DS(j,s), for the last data maintenance function j
            executed as part of refresh run s.
7.4.9.3     The elapsed time of Data Maintenance Test 1, known as TDM1 is the difference between:
          • Data Maintenance Test 1 Start Time, defined as the starting timestamp, DS(1), of the first refresh run
            in Data Maintenance Test 1 or the starting timestamp of the load of refresh data set 1 into the staging
            area (if used), whichever happens first; and
          • Data Maintenance Test 1 End Time, defined as the ending timestamp, DE(Sq/2), of the last refresh
            run in Data Maintenance Test 1, including all EADS updates.
7.4.9.4     The elapsed time of Data Maintenance Test 2, known as TDM2 is the difference between:
          • Data Maintenance Test 2 Start Time, defined as the starting timestamp, DS(Sq/2+1), of the first
            refresh run in Data Maintenance Test 2 or the starting timestamp of the load of the refresh data set 2
            into the staging area (if used), whichever happens first; and
          • Data Maintenance Test 2 End Time, defined as the ending timestamp, DE(Sq), of the last refresh run
            in Data Maintenance Test 2, including all EADS updates.

7.5       Output Data

7.5.1        After execution, a query returns one or more rows. The rows are called the output data. The row count of
             the output data must match the row count of the validation output data, except for differences that are due
             to the precision used to calculate intermediate results during query processing. The test sponsor must
             provide proof that all differences in row count are due to the precision used to calculate intermediate
             results during query processing.

7.5.2        Output data shall adhere to the following guidelines:

              a) Columns appear in the order specified by the SELECT list of the query.
              b) Column headings are optional.
              c) Non-integer expressions including prices are expressed in decimal notation with at least two digits
                 behind the decimal point.
              d) Integer quantities contain no leading zeros.
              e) Dates are expressed in a format that includes the year, month and day in integer form, in that order
                 (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD). The delimiter between the year, month and day is not specified. Other date
                 representations, for example the number of days since 1970-01-01, are specifically not allowed.
              f) Strings are case-sensitive and must be displayed as such. Leading or trailing blanks are acceptable.
              g) The amount of white space between columns is not specified.
              h) NULLs must always be printed by the same string pattern of zero or more characters.
             Comment: The intent of this clause is to assure that output data is expressed in a format easily readable by
             a non-sophisticated computer user, and can be compared with known output data for query validation.
             Comment: Since the reference answer set provided in the specification originated from different data
             processing systems, the reference answer set does not consistently express NULL values with the same
             string pattern.

7.5.3        The precision of all values contained in the output data shall adhere to the following rules:

              a) For singleton column values and results from COUNT aggregates, the values must exactly match the
                 query validation output data.
              b) For ratios, results must be within 1% of the query validation output data when reported to the nearest
                 1/100th, rounded up.
              c) For results from SUM money aggregates, the resulting values must be within $100 of the query
                 validation output data.
              d) For results from AVG aggregates, the resulting values must be within 1% of the query validation
                 output data when reported to the nearest 1/100th, rounded up.

7.6       Metrics

7.6.1        TPC-DS defines three primary metrics:

              a) A Performance Metric, QphDS@SF, reflecting the TPC-DS query throughput (see Clause 7.6.3);
              b) A Price-Performance metric, $/kQphDS@SF (see Clause 7.6.5);
              c) System availability date (see Clause 7.6.6).

7.6.2        TPC-DS also defines several secondary metrics. The secondary metrics are:

              a) Load time, as defined in Clause 7.4.3.7;
              b) Power Test Elapsed time as defined in Clause 7.4.4 and the elapsed time of each query in the Power
                 Test;
              c) Throughput Test 1 and Throughput Test 2 elapsed times, as defined in clauses 7.4.7.3 and 7.4.7.6.
              d) When TPC_Energy option is chosen for reporting, the TPC-DS energy metric reports the power per
                 performance and is expressed as Watts/kQphDS@SF. (see TPC-Energy specification for additional
                 requirements).

             Each secondary metric shall be referenced in conjunction with the scale factor at which it was achieved.
             For example, Load Time references shall take the form of Load Time @ SF, or “Load Time = 10 hours @
             1000”.

7.6.3        The Performance Metric (QphDS@SF)
7.6.3.1      The primary performance metric of the benchmark is QphDS@SF, defined as:
          Where:

          • SF is defined in Clause 3.1.3, and is based on the scale factor used in the benchmark
          • Q is the total number of weighted queries: Q=Sq*99, with Sq being the number of streams
            executed in a Throughput Test
          • TPT=TPower*Sq, where TPower is the total elapsed time to complete the Power Test, as defined in
            Clause 7.4.4, and Sq is the number of streams executed in a Throughput Test
          • TTT= TTT1+TTT2, where TTT1 is the total elapsed time of Throughput Test 1 and TTT2 is the total
            elapsed time of Throughput Test 2, as defined in Clause 7.4.6.
          • TDM= TDM1+TDM2, where TDM1 is the total elapsed time of Data Maintenance Test 1 and TDM2 is the
            total elapsed time of Data Maintenance Test 2, as defined in Clause 7.4.9.
          • TLD is the load factor computed as TLD=0.01*Sq*TLoad, where Sq is the number of streams executed
            in a Throughput Test and TLoad is the time to finish the load, as defined in Clause 7.1.2.
          • TPT, TTT, TDM and TLD quantities are in units of decimal hours with a resolution of at least 1/3600th
            of an hour (i.e., 1 second)

7.6.4     TPerformanceTest is defined as the difference between the Power Test Start Time (see Clause 7.4.5.1) and the
          Data Maintenance Test 2 End Time (see Clause 7.4.9.4)


              Comment:       The floor symbol ( ! " ) in the above equation truncates any fractional part.

7.6.5     The Price Performance Metric ($/kQphDS@SF)

7.6.5.1   The price-performance metric for the benchmark is defined as:
                                                                       1000 ∗ 𝑃
                                                  $/𝑘𝑄𝑝ℎ𝐷𝑆@𝑆𝐹 =
                                                                      𝑄𝑝ℎ𝐷𝑆@𝑆𝐹



          Where:

          P is the price of the Priced System as defined in Clause 9.2.1.

          kQphDS@SF is the reported performance metric as defined in Clause 7.6.3 multiplied by 1000

          Comment: The price-performance metric reflects the price of the Priced System for 1000 QphDS@SF
7.6.5.2   If a benchmark configuration is priced in a currency other than US dollars, the units of the price-performance
          metrics may be adjusted to employ the appropriate currency.

7.6.6     The System Availability Date, as defined in the current revision of the TPC Pricing Specification must be
          disclosed in any references to either the performance or price-performance metric of the benchmark.

7.6.7     Fair Metric Comparison
7.6.7.1   Results at the different scale factors are not comparable, due to the substantially different computational
          challenges found at different data volumes. Similarly, the system price/performance may not scale down
          linearly with a decrease in database size due to configuration changes required by changes in database size.
          If results measured against different database sizes (i.e., with different scale factors) appear in a printed or
          electronic communication, then each reference to a result or metric must clearly indicate the database size
          against which it was obtained. In particular, all textual references to TPC-DS metrics (performance or
          price/performance) appearing must be expressed in the form that includes the size of the test database as an
          integral part of the metric’s name; i.e. including the “@size” suffix. This applies to metrics quoted in text or
          tables as well as those used to annotate charts or graphs. If metrics are presented in graphical form, then the
          test database size on which metric is based must be immediately discernible either by appropriate axis
          labeling or data point labeling.

          In addition, the results must be accompanied by a disclaimer stating:

          "The TPC believes that comparisons of TPC-DS results measured against different database sizes are
          misleading and discourages such comparisons".
7.6.7.2   Any TPC-DS result is comparable to other TPC-DS results regardless of the number of query streams used
          during the test (as long as the scale factors chosen for their respective test databases were the same).

7.6.8     Required Reporting Components

          To be compliant with the TPC-DS standard and the TPC's fair use policies, all public references to TPC-DS
          results for a given configuration must include the following components:

          • The size of the test database, expressed separately or as part of the metric's names (e.g.,
            QphDS@10GB);
          • The TPC-DS Performance Metric, QphDS@Size;
          • The TPC-DS Price/Performance metric, $/kQphDS@Size;
          • The Availability Date of the complete configuration (see the current revision of the TPC Pricing
            Specification located on the TPC website (http://www.tpc.org).

          Following are two examples of compliant reporting of TPC-DS results:

          Example 1: At 10GB the RALF/3000 Server priced at $3,618.02 has a TPC-DS Query-per-Hour metric of
          3,010 when run against a 10GB database yielding a TPC-DS Price/Performance of $1,202 per 1000 QphDS
          and will be available 1-Apr-06.

          Example 2: The RALF/3000 Server, which will start shipping on 1-Apr-06, is rated 3,010 QphDS@10GB
          and 1,202 $/kQphDS@10GB.
                                            8   SUT AND DRIVER IMPLEMENTATION

           This clause defines the System Under Test (SUT) and the benchmark driver.

8.1     Models of Tested Configurations

8.1.1      The tested and reported configuration(s) is composed of a driver that submits queries to a system under test
           (SUT). The SUT executes these queries and replies to the driver. The driver resides on the SUT hardware
           and software.

8.1.2      Figure 8-1 illustrates examples of driver/SUT configurations. The driver is the shaded area. The diagram
           also depicts the driver/SUT boundary (see Clause 7.1.16 and Clause 7.4) where timing intervals are
           measured.

8.2     System Under Test (SUT) Definition

8.2.1      The SUT consists of:

            a) The host system(s) or server(s), including hardware and software supporting access to the database
               employed in the performance test and whose cost and performance are described by the benchmark
               metrics
            b) Any client processing units (e.g., front-end processors, workstations, etc.) used to execute the queries
        c) The hardware and software components needed to communicate with user interface devices
        d) The hardware and software components of all networks required to connect and support the SUT
           components
        e) Data storage media sufficient to satisfy scaling rules in Clause 3, data accessibility properties in Clause
           6.1 and data described in Clause 7.5.

8.2.2   All SUT components, as described in Clause 8.2.1, shall be commercially available software or hardware
        products.

8.2.3   An implementation-specific layer can be implemented on the SUT. This layer shall be logically located
        between the driver and the SUT, as depicted by Figure 8-2.

                                  Figure 8-2: Implementation Specific Layer

                    SUT

8.2.4   If present on the SUT, an implementation-specific layer, shall be minimal and general purpose (i.e., not
        limited to the TPC-DS queries). The source code shall be disclosed. The functions performed by an
        implementation specific layer shall be strictly limited to the following:

        a) Database transaction control operations before and after each query execution
        b) Cursor control and manipulation operations around the executable query text
        c) Definition of procedures and data structures required to process dynamic SQL, including the
           communication of the executable query text to the commercially available layers of the SUT and the
           reception of the query output data
        d) Communication with the commercially available layers of the SUT
        e) Buffering of the query output data
        f) Communication with the drivere it

        The following are examples of functions that the implementation-specific layer shall not perform:
        a) Any modification of the executable query text;
        b) Any use of stored procedures to execute the queries;
        c) Any sorting or translation of the query output data;
        d) Any function prohibited by the requirements of Clause 7.2.8.1.
8.3     Driver Definition

8.3.1      The driver presents the workload to the SUT. The driver is a logical entity that can be implemented using
           one or more programs, processes, or systems. The driver shall perform only the following functions:

            a) Generate a unique stream ID, starting with 1 for each query stream
            b) Sequence queries for execution by the query
            c) Activate, schedule, and/or synchronize the execution of data maintenance functions
            d) Generate the executable query text for each query
            e) Generate values for the substitution parameters of each query
            f) Complete the executable query text by replacing the substitution parameters by the values generated
               for them and, if needed, replacing the text-tokens by the query stream ID
            g) Submit each complete executable query text to the SUT for execution, including the number of rows to
               be returned when specified by the functional query definition
            h) Submit each data maintenance function to the SUT for execution
            i) Receive the output data resulting from each query execution from the SUT
            j) Measure the execution times of the queries and the data maintenance functions and compute
               measurement statistics
            k) Maintain an audit log of query text and query execution output

8.3.2      The generation of executable query text used by the driver to submit queries to the SUT does not need to
           occur on the SUT and does not have to be included in any timing interval.

8.3.3      The driver shall not perform any function other than those described in Clause 8.3.1. Specifically, the
           driver shall not perform any of the following functions:

            a) Performing, activating, or synchronizing any operation other than those mentioned in Clause 8.3.1
            b) Delaying the execution of any query after the execution of the previous query other than for delays
               necessary to process the functions described in Clause 8.3.1. This delay must be reported and can not
               exceed half a second between any two consecutive queries of the same query stream
            c) Modifying the compliant executable query text prior to its submission to the SUT
            d) Embedding the executable query text within a stored procedure definition or an application program
            e) Submitting to the SUT the values generated for the substitution parameters of a query other than as
               part of the executable query text submitted
            f) Submitting to the SUT any data other than the instructions to execute the data maintenance functions,
               the compliant executable query text and, when specified by the functional query definition, the
               number of rows to be returned
            g) Artificially extending the execution time of any query.

8.3.4      The driver is not required to be priced.
                                          9     PRICING

             This section defines the components, functional requirements of what is priced, and what substitutions are
             allowed. Rules for pricing the Priced Configuration and associated software and maintenance are included
             in the current revision of the TPC Pricing Specification located on the TPC website (http://www.tpc.org).



9.1       Pricing Methodology

9.1.1        The Default 1-Year Pricing Methodology (as defined in the TPC Pricing Specification) must be used to
             calculate the price and the price/performance result of the TPC-DS benchmark.

9.1.2        The Pricing Model 1 – Default Pricing Model (as defined in the TPC Pricing Specification) is the only
             pricing model allowed in a TPC-DS result.

9.2       Priced Configuration

             The configuration to be priced shall include hardware, software, licensed compute services and applicable
             maintenance present in the System Under Test (SUT), a communication interface that can support user
             interface devices, additional operational components configured on the test system, and maintenance on all
             of the above

9.2.1        System Under Test

             Calculation of the priced system consists of:

              • Price of the SUT as tested and defined in Clause 8;
              • Price of a communication interface capable of supporting the required number of user interface
                devices defined in Clause 8;
              • Price of on-line storage for the database as described in Clause 9.2.3 and storage for all software
                included in the priced configuration;
              • Price of additional products (software or hardware) required for customary operation,
                administration and maintenance of the SUT for a period defined in the Pricing Methodology
                (Clause 9.1.)
              • Price of all products required to create, execute, administer, and maintain the executable query
                texts and to create and populate the test database.

             Specifically excluded from the priced system calculation are:

              • End-user communication devices and related cables, connectors, and concentrators;
              • Equipment and tools used exclusively in the production of the full disclosure report;
              • Equipment and tools used exclusively for the execution of the dsdgen or dsqgen (see Appendix
                F) programs.0

9.2.2         User Interface Devices and Communications

9.2.2.1      The priced system must include the hardware and software components of a communication interface capable
             of supporting a number of user interface devices (e.g., terminals, workstations, PCs, etc.) at least equal to 10
             times the minimum number of query streams or the actual number of query streams, whichever is greater.
             Comment: Test sponsors are encouraged to configure the SUT with a general-purpose communication
             interface capable of supporting a large number of user interface devices.
9.2.2.2     Only the interface is to be priced. Not to be included in the priced system are the user interface devices
            themselves and the cables, connectors and concentrators used to connect the user interface devices to the SUT.
            For example, in a configuration that includes an Ethernet interface to communicate with PCs, the Ethernet card
            and supporting software must be priced, but not the Ethernet cables and the PCs.
            Comment: Active components (e.g., workstations, PCs, concentrators, etc.) can only be excluded from the
            priced system under the assumption that their role is strictly limited to submitting executable query text
            and receiving output data and that they do not participate in the query execution. All query processing
            performed by the tested configuration is considered part of the performance test and can only be done by
            components that are included in the priced system.
9.2.2.3     The communication interface used must be an industry standard interface, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, or
            RS232.
9.2.2.4     The following diagram illustrates the boundary between what is priced (on the right) and what is not (on the
            left). In the event the driver is a commercial product its price should not be included in the price of the SUT:

9.2.3       Database Storage
9.2.3.1     The storage that is required to be priced includes:
             • storage required to execute the benchmark;
             • storage and media needed to assure that the test database meets the data accessibility
                requirements;
             • storage used to hold optional staging area data.
9.2.3.2     All storage required for the priced system must be present on the tested system.

9.2.4       Additional Operational Components

9.2.4.1     Additional products that might be included on a customer installed configuration, such as operator consoles and
            magnetic tape drives, are also to be included in the priced system if explicitly required for the operation,
            administration, or maintenance, of the priced system.
9.2.4.2     Copies of the software, on appropriate media, and a software load device, if required for initial load or
            maintenance updates, must be included.
9.2.4.3     The price of an Uninterruptible Power Supply, if specifically contributing to a durability solution, must be
            included.
9.2.4.4     The price of all cables used to connect components of the system (except as noted in Clause9.2.2.2) must be
            included.
9.3     Allowable Substitution

9.3.1      Substitution is defined as a deliberate act to replace components of the Priced Configuration by the Test
           Sponsor as a result of failing the availability requirements of the current revision of the TPC Pricing
           Specification or when the Part Number for a component changes.

9.3.2      Some hardware components of the Priced Configuration may be substituted after the Test Sponsor has
           demonstrated to the Auditor's satisfaction that the substituting components do not negatively impact the
           reported TPC-DS Performance Metric. All Substitutions must be reported in the Report and noted in the
           Auditor's Attestation Letter. The following hardware component may be substituted:Durable Medium

9.4     Pricing Period

9.4.1      The pricing period is defined as: TLOAD+TPerformance

            • TLOAD as defined in Clause 7.4.3.8
            • TPerformance as defined in Clause 7.6.4
                                             10 FULL DISCLOSURE

10.1       Reporting Requirements

10.1.1         A Full Disclosure Report (FDR) is required for a benchmark publication. The FDR is a zip file of a directory
               structure containing the following:

10.1.2         A Report in Adobe Acrobat PDF format,

10.1.3         An Executive Summary Statement (ES) in Adobe Acrobat PDF format,

10.1.4         An XML document (“ES.xml”) with approximately the same information as in the Executive Summary
               Statement,

10.1.5         The Supporting Files consisting of various source files, scripts, and listing files.

10.1.6         Requirements for the FDR file directory structure are described below.

10.1.7         The intent of this disclosure is to simplify comparison between results and for a customer to be able to
               replicate the results of this benchmark given appropriate documentation and products.

10.2       Format Guidelines

10.2.1         While established practice or practical limitations may cause a particular benchmark disclosure to differ
               from the examples provided in various small ways, every effort should be made to conform to the format
               guidelines. The intent is to make it as easy as possible for a reviewer to read, compare and evaluate material
               in different benchmark disclosures.

10.2.2         All sections of the report, including appendices, must be printed using font sizes of a minimum of 8 points.

10.2.3         The Executive Summary must be included near the beginning of the full disclosure report.

10.2.4         The directory structure of the FDR has three folders:

           •   ExecutiveSummaryStatement - contains the Executive Summary Statement and ES.xml
           •   Report - contains the Report,
           •   SupportingFiles - contains the Supporting Files.

10.3       Full Disclosure Report Contents

               The FDR should be sufficient to allow an interested reader to evaluate and, if necessary, recreate an
               implementation of TPC-DS. If any sections in the FDR refer to another section of the report (e.g., an
               appendix), the names of the referenced scripts/programs must be clearly labeled in each section.

               Comment: Since the building of a database may consist of a set of scripts and corresponding input files, it
               is important to disclose and clearly identify, by name, scripts and input files in the FDR.

               The order and titles of sections in the test sponsor's full disclosure report must correspond with the order
               and titles of sections from the TPC-DS standard specification (i.e., this document).

10.3.1         General Items
10.3.1.1       A statement identifying the benchmark sponsor(s) and other participating companies must be provided.
10.3.1.2       Settings must be provided for all customer-tunable parameters and options that have been changed from the
               defaults found in actual products, including but not limited to:
                a) Database tuning options;
           b) Optimizer/Query execution options;
           c) Query processing tool/language configuration parameters;
           d) Recovery/commit options;
           e) Consistency/locking options;
           f) Operating system and configuration parameters;
           g) Configuration parameters and options for any other software component incorporated into the pricing
              structure;
           h) Compiler optimization options.
           Comment: In the event that some parameters and options are set multiple times, it must be easily
           discernible by an interested reader when the parameter or option was modified and what new value it
           received each time.
           Comment: This requirement can be satisfied by providing a full list of all parameters and options, as long
           as all those that have been modified from their default values have been clearly identified and these
           parameters and options are only set once.
10.3.1.3   Explicit response to individual disclosure requirements specified in the body of earlier sections of this document
           must be provided.
10.3.1.4   Diagrams of both measured and priced configurations must be provided, accompanied by a description of the
           differences. This includes, but is not limited to:
            a) Number and type of processors (including size of L2 cache);
            b) Size of allocated memory, and any specific mapping/partitioning of memory unique to the test;
            c) Number and type of disk units (and controllers, if applicable);
            d) Number of channels or bus connections to disk units, including their protocol type;
            e) Number of LAN (e.g., Ethernet) connections, including routers, workstations, terminals, etc., that were
                physically used in the test or are incorporated into the pricing structure;
            f) Type and the run-time execution location of software components (e.g., data processing system, query
                processing tools/languages, middleware components, software drivers, etc.).

           The following sample diagram illustrates a measured benchmark configuration using Ethernet, an external
           driver, and four processors in the SUT. Note that this diagram does not depict or imply any optimal
           configuration for the TPC-DS benchmark measurement.

             Comment: Detailed diagrams for system configurations and architectures can vary widely, and it is
             impossible to provide exact guidelines suitable for all implementations. The intent here is to describe the
             system components and connections in sufficient detail to allow independent reconstruction of the
             measurement environment.

10.3.2       Clause 2- Logical Database Design Related Items
10.3.2.1     Listings must be provided for the DDL scripts and must include all table definition statements and all other
             statements used to set-up the test and qualification databases.
10.3.2.2     The physical organization of tables and indices within the test and qualification databases must be disclosed. If
             the column ordering of any table is different from that specified in Clause2.3 or 2.4,, it must be noted.
             Comment: The concept of physical organization includes, but is not limited to: record clustering (i.e.,
             rows from different logical tables are co-located on the same physical data page), index clustering (i.e., rows
             and leaf nodes of an index to these rows are co-located on the same physical data page), and partial fill-
             factors (i.e., physical data pages are left partially empty even though additional rows are available to fill
             them).
10.3.2.3      If any directives to DDLs are used to horizontally partition tables and rows in the test and qualification
             databases, these directives, DDLs, and other details necessary to replicate the partitioning behavior must be
             disclosed.
10.3.2.4     Any replication of physical objects must be disclosed and must conform to the requirements of Clause 2.5.3.

10.3.3       Clause 3 - Scaling and Database Population Related Items
10.3.3.1     The cardinality (e.g., the number of rows) of each table of the test database, as it existed at the completion of the
             database load (see Clause 7.1.2) must be disclosed.
10.3.3.2     The distribution of tables and logs across all media must be explicitly described using a format similar to that
             shown in the following example for both the tested and priced systems.
             Comment: Detailed diagrams for layout of database tables on disks can widely vary, and it is difficult to
             provide exact guidelines suitable for all implementations. The intent is to provide sufficient detail to allow
             independent reconstruction of the test database. The figure that follows is an example of database layout
             descriptions and is not intended to describe any optimal layout for the TPC-DS database.

10.3.3.3    Figure 10-2: Sample Database Layout Description
10.3.3.4    The mapping of database partitions/replications must be explicitly described.
            Comment: The intent is to provide sufficient detail about partitioning and replication to allow
            independent reconstruction of the test database.
10.3.3.5    Implementations may use some form of RAID. The RAID level used must be disclosed for each device. If
            RAID is used in an implementation, the logical intent of its use must be disclosed. Three levels of usage are
            defined:
             a) Base tables only: In this case only the Base Tables (see Clause 2) are protected by any form of RAID;
             b) Base tables and EADS: in addition to the protection of the base tables, implementations in this class
                must also employ RAID to protect all EADS;
             c) Everything: implementations in this usage category must employ RAID to protect all database storage,
                including temporary or scratch space in addition to the base tables and EADS.
10.3.3.6    The version number (i.e., the major revision number, the minor revision number, and third tier number) of
            dsdgen must be disclosed. Any modifications to the dsdgen source code (see Appendix B:) must be disclosed.
            In the event that a program other than dsdgen was used to populate the database, it must be disclosed in its
            entirety.
10.3.3.7    The database load time for the test database (see Clause 7.4.3.7) must be disclosed.
10.3.3.8    The data storage ratio must be disclosed. It is computed by dividing the total data storage of the priced
            configuration (expressed in GB) by SF corresponding to the scale factor chosen for the test database as defined
            in Clause 3.1. The ratio must be reported to the nearest 1/100th, rounded up. For example, a system configured
            with 96 disks of 2.1 GB capacity for a 100GB test database has a data storage ratio of 2.02.
            Comment: For the reporting of configured disk capacity, gigabyte (GB) is defined to be 2^30 bytes. Since
            disk manufacturers typically report disk size using base ten (i.e., GB = 10^9), it may be necessary to convert
            the advertised size from base ten to base two.
10.3.3.9    The details of the database load must be disclosed, including a block diagram illustrating the overall process.
            Disclosure of the load procedure includes all steps, scripts, input and configuration files required to completely
            reproduce the test and qualification databases.
10.3.3.10   Any differences between the configuration of the qualification database and the test database must be disclosed.

10.3.4      Clause 4 and 5 - Query and Data Maintenance -Related Items

10.3.4.1    The query language used to implement the queries must be identified (e.g., "RALF/SQL-Plus").
10.3.4.2    The method of verification for the random number generation must be described unless the supplied dsdgen
            and dsqgen were used.
10.3.4.3    The method used to generate values for substitution parameters must be disclosed. The version number (i.e., the
            major revision number, the minor revision number, and third tier number) of dsqgen must be disclosed..
10.3.4.4    The executable query text used for query validation must be disclosed along with the corresponding output data
            generated during the execution of the query text against the qualification database. If minor modifications have
            been applied to any functional query definitions or approved variants in order to obtain executable query text,
            these modifications must be disclosed and justified. The justification for a particular minor query modification
            can apply collectively to all queries for which it has been used. The output data for the power and Throughput
            Tests must be made available electronically upon request.
            Comment: For query output of more than 10 rows, only the first 10 need to be disclosed in the FDR. The
            remaining rows must be made available upon request.
10.3.4.5    All the query substitution parameters used during the performance test must be disclosed in tabular format,
            along with the seeds used to generate these parameters.
10.3.4.6    All query and refresh session initialization parameters, settings and commands must be disclosed (see Clauses
            7.2.2 through 7.2.7).
10.3.4.7   The details of how the data maintenance functions were implemented must be disclosed (including source code
           of any non-commercial program used).
10.3.4.8   Any object created in the staging area (see Clause 5.1.8 for definition and usage restrictions) used to implement
           the data maintenance functions must be disclosed. Also, any disk storage used for the staging area must be
           priced, and any mapping or virtualization of disk storage must be disclosed.

10.3.5     Clause 6– Data Persistence Properties Related Items
10.3.5.1   The results of the data accessibility tests must be disclosed along with a description of how the data accessibility
           requirements were met.

10.3.6     Clause 7- Performance Metrics and Execution Rules Related Items
10.3.6.1   Any system activity on the SUT that takes place between the conclusion of the load test and the beginning of
           the performance test must be fully disclosed including listings of scripts or command logs.
10.3.6.2   The details of the steps followed to implement the performance test must be disclosed.
10.3.6.3   The timing intervals defined in Clause 7 must be disclosed.
10.3.6.4   For each Throughput Test, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, and the maximum
           times for each query shall be reported.
10.3.6.5   The start time and finish time for each query stream must be reported.
10.3.6.6   The start time and finish time for each refresh run and each data maintenance function in the refresh runs must
           be reported for the Throughput Tests (i.e., all DS(i,s), DE(i,s), DS(s), DE(s) and must be disclosed).
10.3.6.7   The computed performance metric, related numerical quantities and the price/performance metric must be
           reported.
10.3.6.8   Sufficient information that proves that any differences in the row count of the query output data and the
           qualification output data in the qualification test are due to the precision used to calculate intermediate results
           during query processing must be disclosed.

10.3.7     Clause 8 - SUT and Driver Implementation Related Items
10.3.7.1   A detailed textual description of how the driver performs its functions, how its various components interact and
           any product functionalities or environmental settings on which it relies must be provided. All related source
           code, scripts and configuration files must be disclosed. The information provided should be sufficient for an
           independent reconstruction of the driver.
10.3.7.2   If an implementation specific layer is used, then a detailed description of how it performs its functions, how its
           various components interact and any product functionalities or environmental setting on which it relies must be
           provided. All related source code, scripts and configuration files must be disclosed. The information provided
           should be sufficient for an independent reconstruction of the implementation specific layer.
10.3.7.3   If profile-directed optimization as described in Clause 7.2.10 is used, such use must be disclosed. In particular,
           the procedure and any scripts used to perform the optimization must be disclosed.

10.3.8     Clause 9 - Pricing Related Items
10.3.8.1   A detailed list of hardware and software used in the priced system must be reported. The rules for pricing are
           included in the current revision of the TPC Pricing Specification located on the TPC website
           (http://www.tpc.org).
10.3.8.2   The System Availability Date (see Clause 7.6.6) must be the single availability date reported on the first page of
           the executive summary. The full disclosure report must report Availability Dates individually for at least each
           of the categories for which a pricing subtotal must be. All Availability Dates required to be reported must be
           disclosed to a precision of 1 day, but the precise format is left to the test sponsor.
              Comment: A test sponsor may disclose additional detail on the availability of the system’s components in
              the Notes section of the Executive Summary and may add a footnote reference to the System Availability
              Date.
10.3.8.3      Additional Clause 7 related items may be included in the full disclosure report for each country specific priced
              configuration.

10.3.9        Clause 11 - Audit Related Items
10.3.9.1      The auditor's agency name, address, phone number, and attestation letter with a brief audit summary report
              indicating compliance must be included in the full disclosure report. A statement should be included specifying
              whom to contact in order to obtain further information regarding the audit process.

10.4       Executive Summary

              The executive summary is meant to be a high level overview of a TPC-DS implementation. It should
              provide the salient characteristics of a benchmark execution (metrics, configuration, pricing, etc.) without
              the exhaustive detail found in the FDR. When the TPC-Energy optional reporting is selected by the test
              sponsor, the additional requirements and format of TPC-Energy related items in the executive summary are
              included in the TPC Energy Specification, located at www.tpc.org.

              The executive summary has three components:

              Implementation and Cost of Ownership Overview

              Pricing Spreadsheet

              Numerical Quantities

10.4.1        Page Layout

              Each component of the executive summary should appear on a page by itself. Each page should use a
              standard header and format, including

               a) 1/2 inch margins, top and bottom;
               b) 3/4 inch left margin, 1/2 inch right margin;
               c) 2 pt. frame around the body of the page. All interior lines should be 1 pt;
               d) Sponsor identification and System identification, each set apart by a 1 pt. rule, in 16-20 pt. Times Bold
                  font.

                  date, separated from other header items and each other by a 1 pt. Rule, in 9-12 pt. Times font.
              Comment: It is permissible to use or include company logos when identifying the sponsor.
              Comment: The report date must be disclosed with a precision of 1 day. The precise format is left to the
              test sponsor.
              Comment: Appendix E contains a sample executive summary. It is meant to help clarify the requirements
              in Clause 10.4 and is provided solely as an example.

10.4.2        Implementation Overview
                  Implementation and Cost of Ownership Overview

                  The implementation overview page contains six sets of data, each laid out across the page as a sequence of
                  boxes using 1 pt. rule, with a title above the required quantity. Both titles and quantities should use a 9-12
                  pt. Times font unless otherwise noted.

                  The middle portion of the page must contain two diagrams, which must be of equal size and fill out the
                  entire space. The left diagram shows the benchmarked configuration and the right diagram shows a pie
                  chart with the percentages of the total time and the total times for the Load Test, Throughput Test 1, and
                  Throughput Test 2.

                  The next section must contain a synopsis of the SUT's major system components, including:

                  • Total number of nodes used/total number of processors used with their types and speeds in
                    GHz/ total number of cores used/total number of threads used;
                  • Main and cache memory sizes;
                  • Network and I/O connectivity;
                  • Disk quantity and geometry.

                  If the implementation used a two-tier architecture, front-end and back-end systems must be detailed
                  separately.
10.4.2.1          The first section contains the results that were obtained from the reported runs of the Performance test.

                  Comment: The Software Version must uniquely identify the orderable software product referenced in the
                  Priced Configuration (e.g., RALF/2000 4.2.1)
10.4.2.2          The middle portion of the page must contain two diagrams, which must be of equal size and fill out the width of
                  the entire space. The left diagram shows the benchmarked configuration and the right diagram shows a pie
                  chart with the percentages of the total time and the total times for the Load Test, Throughput Test 1 and

10.4.2.4         The next section of the Implementation Overview shall contain a synopsis of the SUT’s major components,
              including:

              Node and/or processor count and speed in GHz;

              Main and cache memory sizes;

              Network and IO connectivity;

              Disk quantity and geometry

              Total mass storage in the priced system.


                   If the implementation used a two-tier architecture, front-end and back-end systems should be defined
              separately.
10.4.2.5       The final section of the Implementation Overview shall contain a note stating:
              “Database Size includes only raw data (i.e., no temp, index, redundant storage space, etc.).”

10.4.3         Pricing Spreadsheet

              The pricing spreadsheet, required by Clause 10.4, must be reproduced in its entirety. Refer to Appendix E
              for a sample pricing spreadsheet.

10.4.4         Numerical Quantities Summary

              The Numerical Quantities Summary page contains three sets of data.

               1. The first set is the number of query streams.
               2. The second set contains the Start Date, Start Time, End Date, End Time, and Elapsed Time for:
                  • Database Load
                   • Power Test
                   • Throughput Test 1
                   • Data Maintenance Test 1
                   • Throughput Test 2
                  • Data Maintenance Test 2.
               3. The third set is a table which contains the information required by Clause 10.3.6.4 .
10.4.5      ES.xml Requirements

            The schema of the ES.xml document is defined by the XML schema document tpcds-es.xsd located on the
            TPC website (http://www.tpc.org). The ES.xml file must conform to the tpcds-es.xsd (established by XML
            schema validation).

            Comment: The Sponsor is responsible for verifying that the ES.xml file they provide in the Full
            Disclosure Report conforms to the TPC-DS XML schema. A validation tool will be provided on the TPC
            web site to facilitate this verification.

            Appendix G describes the structure of the XML schema, defines the individual fields, and explains how to
            use the schema.

10.5     Availability of the Full Disclosure Report

10.5.1      The full disclosure report must be readily available to the public at a reasonable charge, similar to charges
            for comparable documents by that test sponsor. The report must be made available when results are made
            public. In order to use the phrase "TPC Benchmark DS", the full disclosure report must have been
            submitted electronically to the TPC using the procedure described in the TPC Policies document.

10.5.2      The official full disclosure report must be available in English but may be translated to additional
            languages.

10.6     Revisions to the Full Disclosure Report

            Revisions to the full disclosure documentation shall be handled as follows:

             a) Fully documented price changes can be reflected in a new published price/performance. The
                benchmark need not be rerun to remain compliant.
             b) Hardware or software product substitutions within the SUT, with the exception of equipment
                emulated as allowed under Clause 8, require the benchmark to be re-run with the new components in
                order to re-establish compliance. For any substitution of equipment emulated during the benchmark, a
                new demonstration must be provided.
             c) The revised report shall be submitted as defined in Clause10.2.1.
            Comment: During the normal product life cycle, problems will be uncovered that require changes,
            sometimes referred to as patches or updates. When the cumulative result of applied changes causes the
            performance metric (see Clause 7.6.3) to decrease by more than 2% from the reported value, then the test
            sponsor is required to re-validate the benchmark results.
             a) Fully documented price changes can be reflected in a new published price/performance.
             b) When cumulative price changes have resulted in a worsening of the reported price/performance by 2%
                or more the test sponsor must submit revised price/performance results to the TPC within 30 days of
                the effective date of the price change(s) to remain in compliance. The benchmark need not be re-run
                to remain in compliance.
            Comment: The intent of this Clause is that published price/performance reflect actual current
            price/performance.
             a) A change in the committed availability date for the priced system can be reflected in a new published
                availability date.
             b) A report may be revised to add or delete Clause 9 related items for country-specific priced
                configurations.
             c) Full disclosure report revisions may be required for other reasons as specified in the TPC Policies and
                Guidelines document, and must be submitted using the mechanisms described therein.

10.7     Derived Results

10.7.1      TPC-DS results can be used as the basis for new TPC-DS results if and only if:

             a) The auditor ensures that the hardware and software products are the same as those used in the prior
                result;
             b) The auditor reviews the FDR of the new results and ensures that they match what is contained in the
                original sponsor's FDR;
             c) The auditor can attest to the validity of the pricing used in the new FDR.
             d) The intent of this clause is to allow a reseller of equipment from a given supplier to publish under the
                re-seller's name a TPC-DS result already published by the supplier.
10.8 Supporting Files Index Table

        An index for all files required by Clause 10.2.4 Supporting Files must be provided in the Report. The
        Supporting Files index is presented in a tabular format where the columns specify the following:
        •   The first column denotes the clause in the TPC Specification
        •   The second column provides a short description of the file contents
        •   The third column contains the path name for the file starting at the SupportingFiles directory.
        If there are no Supporting Files provided then the description column must indicate that there is no supporting
        file and the path name column must be left blank.
        The following table is an example of the Supporting Files Index Table that must be reported in the Report.

  10.9 Supporting Files

         The Supporting Files contain human readable and machine executable (i.e., able to be performed by the
         appropriate program without modification) scripts, executables and source code that are required to recreate
         the benchmark Result. If there is a choice of using a GUI or a script, then the machine executable script must
         be provided in the Supporting Files. If no corresponding script is available for a GUI, then the Supporting Files
         must contain a detailed step by step description of how to manipulate the GUI.
         The combination of the following rules shall allow anybody to reproduce the benchmark result.
            • All software developed specifically for the benchmark must be included in the supporting files if
              the software was used to cover the requirements of a clause of the benchmark specification or to
              conduct a benchmark run with the SUT. This includes machine executable code in the form of
              scripts (e.g., .sql, .sh, .tcsh, .cmd, or .bat files) or source code (e.g., .cpp, .cc, .cxx, .c files).
              Specifically developed executables (e.g., .exe files) need to be included unless their source code
              has been provided in the supporting files with detailed instructions (e.g., make files) how to re-
              generate the executables from the source for the hardware and operating system used for the
              benchmark.
            • References (e.g., URLs) need to be provided for all software available for general purchase or
              download which has NOT been developed specifically for the benchmark. The software must be
              available under the location provided by the references for the time the benchmark is published
              on the TPC website.
            • All command line options used to invoke any of the above programs need to be disclosed. If a
              GUI is used, detailed instructions on how to navigate the GUI as used to reproduce the
              benchmark result need to be disclosed.
         The directory structure under SupportingFiles must follow the clause numbering from the TPC-DS Standard
         Specification (i.e., this document). The directory name is specified by the 10.9 third level Clauses immediately
         preceding the fourth level Supporting Files reporting requirements. If there is more than one instance of one
         type of file, subfolders may be used for each instance. For example if multiple Tier A machines were used in
         the benchmark, there may be a folder for each Tier A machine.
         File names should be chosen to indicate to the casual reader what is contained within the file. For example, if
         the requirement is to provide the scripts for all table definition statements and all other statements used to set-
         up the database, file names of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 are unacceptable. File names that include the text “tables”, “index”
         or “frames” should be used to convey to the reader what is being created by the script.

10.9.1     SupportingFiles/Introduction Directory

           All scripts required to configure the hardware must be reported in the Supporting Files.

           All scripts required to configure the software must be reported in the Supporting Files. This includes any
           Tunable Parameters and options which have been changed from the defaults in commercially available
           products, including but not limited to:

            • Database tuning options.
            • Recovery/commit options.
            • Consistency/locking options.
            • Operating System and application configuration parameters.
            • Compilation and linkage options and run-time optimizations used to create/install applications,
              OS, and/or databases.
            • Parameters, switches or flags that can be changed to modify the behavior of the product.
           Comment: This requirement can be satisfied by providing a full list of all parameters and options.

10.9.2     SupportingFiles/Clause2 Directory
         Scripts must be provided for all table definition statements and all other statements used to set-up the
         database. All scripts must be human readable and machine executable (i.e., able to be performed by the
         appropriate program without modification). All scripts are to be reported in the Supporting Files.

10.9.3   SupportingFiles/Clause3 Directory

         Scripts must be provided for all dsdgen invocations used to populate the database with content. All scripts
         must be human readable and machine executable (i.e., able to be performed by the appropriate program
         without modification). All scripts are to be reported in the Supporting Files.

10.9.4   SupportingFiles/Clause4 Directory

         The implementation of each query of the benchmark as defined per Clause 4 must be reported in the
         Supporting Files. This includes, but is not limited to, the code implementing the queries of this
         benchmark.

10.9.5   SupportingFiles/Clause5 Directory

         Scripts must be provided for all steps used to maintain the database content in order to implement Clause 5.
         All scripts must be human readable and machine executable (i.e., able to be performed by the appropriate
         program without modification). All scripts are to be reported in the Supporting Files.

10.9.6   SupportingFiles/Clause6 Directory

         Scripts must be provided for all steps used to validate Clause 6. All scripts must be human readable and
         machine executable (i.e., able to be performed by the appropriate program without modification). All
         scripts and the output of the scripts are to be reported in the Supporting Files.

10.9.7   SupportingFiles/Clause7 Directory

         No requirements

                                           11 AUDIT

              This clause defines the audit requirements for TPC-DS. The auditor needs to ensure that the benchmark
              under audit complies with the TPC-DS specification. Rules for auditing Pricing information are included in
              the current revision of the TPC Pricing Specification located at www.tpc.org. When the TPC-Energy
              optional reporting is selected by the test sponsor, the rules for auditing of TPC-Energy related items are
              included in the TPC Energy Specification located at www.tpc.org.

11.1       General Rules

11.1.1        An independent audit of the benchmark results by a TPC certified auditor is required. The term
              independent is defined as "the outcome of the benchmark carries no financial benefit to the auditing
              agency other than fees earned directly related to the audit." In addition, the auditing agency cannot have
              supplied any performance consulting under contract for the benchmark.

              In addition, the following conditions must be met:

              a)   The auditing agency cannot be financially related to the sponsor. For example, the auditing agency is
                   financially related if it is a dependent division of the sponsor, the majority of its stock is owned by the
                   sponsor, etc.

              b) The auditing agency cannot be financially related to any one of the suppliers of the measured/priced
                 configuration, e.g., the data processing system supplier, the disk supplier, etc.

11.1.2        The auditor's attestation letter is to be made readily available to the public as part of the full disclosure
              report. A detailed report from the auditor is not required.

11.1.3        TPC-DS results can be used as the basis for new TPC-DS results if and only if:

              The auditor ensures that the hardware and software products are the same as those used in the prior result;

              The auditor reviews the FDR of the new results and ensures that they match what is contained in the
              original sponsor's FDR;

              The auditor can attest to the validity of the pricing used in the new FDR.

              Comment: The intent of this clause is to allow a reseller of equipment from a given supplier to publish
              under the re-seller's name a TPC-DS result already published by the supplier.
              Comment: In the event that all conditions listed in Clause 11.1.2 are met, the auditor is not required to
              follow the remaining auditor's check list items from Clause 11.2.

11.1.4        In the event that a remote audit procedure is used in the context of a change-based audit, a remote
              connection to the SUT must be available for the auditor to verify selected audit items from Clause 9.2

11.2       Auditor's Check List

11.2.1        This clause defines the minimal audit checks that the auditor is required to conduct for TPC-DS. In order
              for the auditor to ensure that the benchmark under audit complies with the TPC-DS specification the
              auditor is allowed to ask for additional checks.

11.2.2        Clause 2 Related Items

11.2.2.1      Verify that the data types used for each column are conformant. For example, verify that decimal columns can
              be incremented by 0.01 from -9,999,999,999.99.
11.2.2.2   Verify that the tables have the required list of columns.
11.2.2.3   Verify that the implementation rules are met by the test database.
11.2.2.4   Verify that the test database meets the data access transparency requirements.
11.2.2.5   Verify that conforming arbitrary data values can be inserted into any of the tables. Examples of verification tests
           include:
            • Inserting a row that is a complete duplicate of an existing row except for a distinct primary key;
            • Inserting a row with column values within the domain of the data type and check constraints but
               beyond the range of existing values.
11.2.2.6   Ensure that all EADS satisfy the requirements of Clause 2.5.3
11.2.2.7   Verify that the set of EADS that are present and enabled at the end of the load test are the same set that are
           present and enabled at the end of the performance test as required by Clause 2.5.3.6. A similar check may be
           performed at any point during the performance test at the discretion of the auditor. Note the method used to
           verify that this requirement has been met.

           [This auditor clause states a requirement that does not appear to be stated before (that no ADS can be created
           during the test). If such a requirement exists it should be stated in clause 2.]

11.2.3     Clause 3 Related Items
11.2.3.1   Verify that the qualification and test databases are properly scaled and populated.
11.2.3.2   Verify that the qualification and test databases were constructed in the same manner so that correct behavior on
           the qualification database is indicative of correct behavior on the test database.
11.2.3.3   Note the method used to populate the database (i.e., dsdgen or modified version of dsdgen). Note the version
           number (i.e., the major revision number, the minor revision number, and third tier number) of dsdgen, and the
           names of the dsdgen files which have been modified. Verify that the major and minor revision numbers of the
           dsdgen version match those of the benchmark specification.
11.2.3.4   Verify that storage and processing elements that are not included in the priced configuration are physically
           removed or made inaccessible during the performance test using a vendor supported method.
11.2.3.5   Verify that the validation data sets are proven consistent with the data loaded into the database according to
           clause 3.5.
11.2.3.6   Verify referential integrity in the database after the initial load. Referential Integrity is a data property that can
           be verified by checking that every foreign key has a corresponding primary key.
11.2.4     Clause 4 Related Items
11.2.4.1   Verify that the basis for the SQL used for each query is the functional query definition or an approved variant or
           meets Clause 9.2.3.2.
11.2.4.2   Verify that any deviation in the SQL from either the functional query definition or an approved variant is
           compliant with the specified minor query modifications. Verify that minor query modifications have been
           applied consistently to the set of functional query definitions or approved variants used.
11.2.4.3   Verify that the executable query text produces the required output when executed against the qualification
           database using the validation values for substitution parameters.
11.2.4.4   Note the method used to generate the values for substitution parameters (i.e., dsqgen, modified version of
           dsqgen, other method). If dsqgen was used, note the version number (i.e., the major revision number, the minor
           revision number, and third tier number) of dsqgen. Verify that the major and minor revision numbers of the
           dsqgen version match those of the benchmark specification.
11.2.4.5   Verify that the generated substitution parameters are correctly generated. For each stream take 10 random
           queries and verify their substitution values.
11.2.4.6   Verify that no aspect of the system under test, except for the database size, has changed between the
           demonstration of compliance against the qualification database and the execution of the reported measurements.
11.2.5     Clause 5 Related Items

11.2.5.1   Verify immediately after the performance test that all EADS that were created as part of the database load are
           correctly maintained. This test is to be conducted with a script that performs the following two types of
           subtests:
            1. For any index measure the response time for index lookups of two keys, one that was loaded during the
               database load test and one that was loaded during the data maintenance test. The lookup query
               response times should not be substantially different from each other (e.g. difference should not be
               more than 50%).
           2. Create another instance for all non–index EADS using the same directives as used for the original
              EADS. Verify that the creation of the second instance does not query the original EADS. Verify that
              their content is logically identical.
11.2.5.2   Verify that the logic of the data maintenance functions are implemented according to their definition (see
           Clause 5.3).
11.2.5.3   Verify that the data maintenance functions insert and delete the correct rows. For each data maintenance
           function in a random stream verify that 2 random rows have been correctly inserted and deleted.
11.2.5.4   Verify that the order of the data maintenance functions is in accordance with Clause 5.1.3.
11.2.5.5   Verify that the method used to implement and execute database maintenance operations is in accordance with
           Clause 5.1.5.

11.2.6     Verify that the refresh data loaded as part of each data maintenance function is in accordance with Clause
           5.2.4
11.2.7     Clause 6 Related Items

11.2.7.1   Verify that the required data accessibility properties are supported by the system under test as configured for the
           execution of the reported measurements.
11.2.8     Clause 7 Related Items

11.2.8.1   Verify that the execution rules are followed for the Load Test, Power Test, Throughput Tests 1 and 2, and Data
           Maintenance Tests 1 and 2.
11.2.8.2   Verify that the database load time is measured according to the requirements.
11.2.8.3   Verify that the queries are executed against the test database.
11.2.8.4   Verify that the query sequencing rules are followed.
11.2.8.5   Verify that the measurement interval for the Throughput Tests is measured as required.
11.2.8.6   Verify that the method used to measure the timing intervals is compliant.
11.2.8.7   Verify that the metrics are computed as required.
11.2.8.8   Verify that any profile-directed optimization performed by the test sponsor conforms to the requirements of
           Clause 7.2.
11.2.8.9   Verify the set of EADS that exist at the end of the load test exist and are valid and up to date at the end of the
           performance test by querying the meta data of the test database before the Power Test and after Throughput Test
           2. If there is any doubt that the EADS are not maintained the auditor shall run additional tests.
11.2.9     Clause 8 Related Items

11.2.9.1   Verify that the driver meets the requirements of Clauses 8.3.
11.2.10    Clause 9 Related Items
11.2.10.1   Verify that the composition of the SUT is in compliance with the Clause 9 and that its components will be
            commercially available products according to the current version of TPC pricing specification.
11.2.10.2   Note whether an implementation specific layer is used and verify its compliance with Clause 9.1.
11.2.10.3   Verify that all required components of the SUT are priced according to the current version of TPC pricing
            specification.
11.2.10.4   Verify that a user communication interface is included in the SUT.
11.2.10.5   Verify that all required maintenance is priced according to the current version of TPC pricing specification.
11.2.10.6   Verify that any discount used is generally available and complies according to the current version of TPC
            pricing specification.
11.2.10.7   Verify that any third-party pricing complies with the requirements of TPC pricing specification.

11.2.11     Verify that the pricing spreadsheet includes all hardware and software licenses, warranty coverage, and
            additional maintenance costs as required according to the current version of TPC pricing specification.

            Comment: Since final pricing for new products is typically set very close to the product announcement
            date, the auditor is not required to verify the final pricing of the tested system.

11.2.12     Clause 10 Related Items

11.2.12.1   Verify that major portions of the full disclosure report are accurate and comply with the reporting requirements.
            This includes:
             • The executive summary;
             • The numerical quantity summary;
             • The diagrams of both measured and priced configurations;
             • The block diagram illustrating the database load process.

Appendix E: Sample Executive Summary
                                      Appendix F: Tool Set Requirements

F.1     Introduction

      In addition to this document, TPC-DS relies on material that is only available electronically. While not
      included in the printed version of the specification, this “soft appendix” is integral to the submission of a
      compliant TPC-DS benchmark result.

F.2     Availability

      Need to confirm and any other legalese with TPC

      The electronically available specification content may be downloaded from the TPC-DS section of the TPC
      web site located on the TPC website (http://www.tpc.org) free of charge. It is solely intended for use in
      conjunction with the execution of a TPC-DS benchmark. Any other use is prohibited without the express,
      prior written consent of the TPC.

F.3     Compatibility

      This material is maintained, versioned and revised independently of the specification itself. It is the
      benchmark sponsor’s responsibility to assure that any benchmark submission relies on a revision of the soft
      appendix that is compliant with the revision of the TPC-DS specification against which the result is being
      submitted.

      The soft appendix includes a version number similar to that used in the specification, with a major version
      number, a minor version number and a third tier level, each separated by a decimal point. The major and
      minor revision numbers are tied to those of the TPC-DS specification with which the soft appendix is
      compliant. The third tier level of the soft appendix is incremented whenever the appendix itself is updated,
      and is independent of revision changes or updates to the specification.

      A revision of the soft appendix may be used to submit a TPC-DS benchmark result provided that the major
      revision number of the soft appendix matches that of a specification revision that is eligible for benchmark
      submission;

      Comment: The intent of this clause is to allow for the possibly lengthy tuning and preparation cycle that
      precedes a benchmark submission, during which a third tier revision could be released.

      Benchmark sponsors are encouraged to use the most recent patch level of a given soft appendix version, as
      it will contain the latest clarifications and bug fixes, but any third tier level may be used to produce a
      compliant benchmark submission as long as the prior conditions are met.
