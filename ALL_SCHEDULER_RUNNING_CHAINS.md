# ALL_SCHEDULER_RUNNING_CHAINS

               `ALL_SCHEDULER_RUNNING_CHAINS` displays information about the chain steps of the running chains accessible to the current user (that is, those chains that the user has `ALTER` privileges for). In the case of nested chains, this view also enables you to traverse the hierarchy of the chain with a SQL statement that contains a `CONNECT BY` clause linking up the `JOB_SUBNAME` and `STEP_JOB_SUBNAME` columns.
