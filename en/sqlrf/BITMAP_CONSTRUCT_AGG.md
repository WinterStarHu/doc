## Purpose
`BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG ` is an aggregation function that operates on bit positions and returns the bitmap representation of the set of all input bit positions. It essentially maintains a bitmap and sets into it all the input bit positions. It returns the representation of the bitmap.
The argument `expr` is of type `NUMBER`.
The return type is of type `BLOB`.
If `expr` is NULL, the function returns NULL.
**Restrictions**
````
```
62575, 00000, "Invalid value has been passed to a BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT related operator."
// *Cause: An attempt was made to pass an invalid value to a BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT operator.
// *Action: Pass only natural number values to BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG.
```
- The argument must be of NUMBER type. If the input value cannot be converted to a natural number, error ORA-62575 is raised:
````
- If the bitmap exceeds the maximum value of a BLOB, you will see error ORA-62577:
```
62577, 00000, "The bitmap size exceeds maximum size of its SQL data type."
// *Cause: An attempt was made to construct a bitmap larger than its maximum SQL type size.
// *Action: Break the input to BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG into smaller ranges.
```
