## Purpose
`FEATURE_SET` returns a set of feature ID and feature value pairs for each row in the selection. The return value is a varray of objects with field names `FEATURE_ID` and `VALUE`. The data type of both fields is `NUMBER`.
## topN and cutoff
You can specify *topN* and *cutoff* to limit the number of features returned by the function. By default, both *topN* and *cutoff* are null and all features are returned.
******
- topN is the N highest value features. If multiple features have the Nth value, then the function chooses one of them.
********
- cutoff is a value threshold. Only features that are greater than or equal to cutoff are returned. To filter by cutoff only, specify NULL for topN.
To return up to *N* features that are greater than or equal to *cutoff*, specify both *topN* and *cutoff*.
## Syntax Choice
`FEATURE_SET` can score the data in one of two ways: It can apply a mining model object to the data, or it can dynamically mine the data by executing an analytic clause that builds and applies one or more transient mining models. Choose **Syntax** or **Analytic Syntax**:
****
- Syntax — Use the first syntax to score the data with a pre-defined model. Supply the name of a feature extraction model.
****************
- Analytic Syntax — Use the analytic syntax to score the data without a pre-defined model. Include INTO n, where n is the number of features to extract, and mining_analytic_clause, which specifies if the data should be partitioned for multiple model builds. The mining_analytic_clause supports a query_partition_clause and an order_by_clause. (See “analytic_clause::=”.)
The syntax of the `FEATURE_SET` function can use an optional `GROUPING` hint when scoring a partitioned model. See GROUPING Hint.
## mining_attribute_clause
*mining_attribute_clause* identifies the column attributes to use as predictors for scoring. When the function is invoked with the analytic syntax, these predictors are also used for building the transient models. The *mining_attribute_clause* behaves as described for the `PREDICTION` function. (See “mining_attribute_clause::=”.)

## Example
This example lists the top features corresponding to a given customer record and determines the top attributes for each feature (based on coefficient > 0.25).
