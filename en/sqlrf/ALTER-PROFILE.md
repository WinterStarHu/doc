# ALTER PROFILE

## Purpose
Use the `ALTER` `PROFILE` statement to add, modify, or remove a resource limit or password management parameter in a profile.
Changes made to a profile with an `ALTER` `PROFILE` statement affect users only in their subsequent sessions, not in their current sessions.
**See Also:**   CREATE PROFILE for information on creating a profile
## Prerequisites
You must have the `ALTER` `PROFILE` system privilege.
To specify the `CONTAINER` clause, you must be connected to a multitenant container database (CDB). To specify `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL`, the current container must be the root. To specify `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT`, the current container must be a pluggable database (PDB).

## Semantics
The keywords, parameters, and clauses in the `ALTER` `PROFILE` statement all have the same meaning as in the `CREATE` `PROFILE` statement.
You cannot remove a limit from the `DEFAULT` profile.
Refer to CREATE PROFILE and to the examples in the next section for more information.
## Examples
**Making a Password Unavailable: Example**
The following statement makes the password of the `new_profile` profile (created in “Creating a Profile: Example”) unavailable for reuse for 90 days:
```
ALTER PROFILE new_profile
   LIMIT PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME 90
   PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX UNLIMITED;
```
**Setting Default Password Values: Example**
The following statement defaults the `PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME` value of the `app_user` profile (created in “Setting Profile Resource Limits: Example”) to its defined value in the `DEFAULT` profile:
```
ALTER PROFILE app_user
   LIMIT PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME DEFAULT
   PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX UNLIMITED;
```
**Limiting Login Attempts and Password Lock Time: Example**
The following statement alters profile `app_user` with `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` set to 5 and `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` set to 1:
```
ALTER PROFILE app_user LIMIT
   FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 5
   PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 1;
```
This statement causes any user account to which the `app_user` profile is assigned to become locked for one day after five consecutive unsuccessful login attempts.
**Changing Password Lifetime and Grace Period: Example**
The following statement modifies the profile `app_user2` `PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME` to 90 days and `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME` to 5 days:
```
ALTER PROFILE app_user2 LIMIT
   PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 90
   PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME 5;
```
**Limiting Account Inactivity: Example**
The following statement modifies the profile `app_user2` `INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME` to 30 consecutive days:
```
ALTER PROFILE app_user2 LIMIT
  INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME 30;
```
If the account has already been inactive for a certain number of days, then those days count toward the new 30 day limit.
**Limiting Concurrent Sessions: Example**
This statement defines a new limit of 5 concurrent sessions for the `app_user` profile:
```
ALTER PROFILE app_user LIMIT SESSIONS_PER_USER 5;
```
If the `app_user` profile does not currently define a limit for `SESSIONS_PER_USER`, then the preceding statement adds the limit of 5 to the profile. If the profile already defines a limit, then the preceding statement redefines it to 5. Any user assigned the `app_user` profile is subsequently limited to 5 concurrent sessions.
**Removing Profile Limits: Example**
This statement removes the `IDLE_TIME `limit from the `app_user` profile:
```
ALTER PROFILE app_user LIMIT IDLE_TIME DEFAULT;
```
Any user assigned the `app_user` profile is subject in their subsequent sessions to the `IDLE_TIME` limit defined in the `DEFAULT` profile.
**Limiting Profile Idle Time: Example**
This statement defines a limit of 2 minutes of idle time for the `DEFAULT` profile:
```
ALTER PROFILE default LIMIT IDLE_TIME  2;
```
This `IDLE_TIME` limit applies to these users:
- Users who are not explicitly assigned any profile
- Users who are explicitly assigned a profile that does not define an IDLE_TIME limit
This statement defines unlimited idle time for the `app_user2` profile:
```
ALTER PROFILE app_user2 LIMIT IDLE_TIME UNLIMITED;
```
Any user assigned the `app_user2` profile is subsequently permitted unlimited idle time.
**Enable Gradual Password Rollover: Example**
This statement sets the password rollover time to 2 days in the profile `usr_prof`:
```
ALTER PROFILE usr_prof LIMIT PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME 2 ;
```
