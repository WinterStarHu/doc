# DROP DATABASE LINK

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `DATABASE` `LINK` statement to remove a database link from the database.
**See Also:**   CREATE DATABASE LINK for information on creating database links
## Prerequisites
A private database link must be in your own schema. To drop a `PUBLIC` database link, you must have the `DROP` `PUBLIC` `DATABASE` `LINK` system privilege.
## Syntax
## *drop_database_link*::=
Description of the illustration drop_database_link.eps
## Semantics
## PUBLIC
You must specify `PUBLIC` to drop a `PUBLIC` database link.
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to drop an existing database link.
**Note:**   You can only use `IF EXISTS` from Release 19.28 and up.
## *dblink*
Specify the name of the database link to be dropped.
**Restriction on Dropping Database Links**
You cannot drop a database link in another user’s schema, and you cannot qualify *dblink* with the name of a schema, because periods are permitted in names of database links. Therefore, Oracle Database interprets the entire name, such as `ralph.linktosales`, as the name of a database link in your schema rather than as a database link named `linktosales` in the schema `ralph`.
## Examples
**Dropping a Database Link: Example**
The following statement drops the public database link named `remote`, which was created in “Defining a Public Database Link: Example”:
```
DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK remote;
```
