# PREVIOUS

## Syntax
Description of the illustration previous.gif
Description of the illustration previous.eps
## Purpose
The `PREVIOUS` function can be used only in the *model_clause* of the `SELECT` statement and then only in the `ITERATE` … [ `UNTIL` `]` clause of the *model_rules_clause*. It returns the value of *cell_reference* at the beginning of each iteration.
**See Also:**
**
- model_clause and “Model Expressions” for the syntax and semantics
**
- in Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide for the collation derivation rules, which define the collation assigned to the return value of PREVIOUS when it is a character value
## Examples
The following example repeats the rules, up to 1000 times, until the difference between the values of `cur_val` at the beginning and at the end of an iteration is less than one:
```
SELECT dim_col, cur_val, num_of_iterations
  FROM (SELECT 1 AS dim_col, 10 AS cur_val FROM dual)
  MODEL
    DIMENSION BY (dim_col)
    MEASURES (cur_val, 0 num_of_iterations)
    IGNORE NAV
    UNIQUE DIMENSION
    RULES ITERATE (1000) UNTIL (PREVIOUS(cur_val[1]) - cur_val[1] < 1)
    (
      cur_val[1] = cur_val[1]/2,
      num_of_iterations[1] = num_of_iterations[1] + 1
    );
   DIM_COL    CUR_VAL NUM_OF_ITERATIONS
---------- ---------- -----------------
         1       .625                 4
