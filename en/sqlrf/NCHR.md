## Purpose
`NCHR` returns the character having the binary equivalent to *number* in the national character set. The value returned is always `NVARCHAR2`. This function is equivalent to using the `CHR` function with the `USING` `NCHAR_CS` clause.
This function takes as an argument a `NUMBER` value, or any value that can be implicitly converted to `NUMBER`, and returns a character.
