# DROP VIEW

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `VIEW` statement to remove a view or an object view from the database. You can change the definition of a view by dropping and re-creating it.
**See Also:**   CREATE VIEW and ALTER VIEW for information on creating and modifying a view
## Prerequisites
The view must be in your own schema or you must have the `DROP` `ANY` `VIEW` system privilege.
## Syntax
## *drop_view*::=
Description of the illustration drop_view.eps
## Semantics
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to drop an existing view.
## *schema*
Specify the schema containing the view. If you omit *schema*, then Oracle Database assumes the view is in your own schema.
## *view*
Specify the name of the view to be dropped.
Oracle Database does not drop views, materialized views, and synonyms that are dependent on the view but marks them `INVALID`. You can drop them or redefine views and synonyms, or you can define other views in such a way that the invalid views and synonyms become valid again.
If any subviews have been defined on *view*, then the database invalidates the subviews as well. To determine whether the view has any subviews, query the `SUPERVIEW_NAME` column of the `USER_`, `ALL_`, or `DBA_VIEWS` data dictionary views.
**See Also:**
- CREATE TABLE and CREATE SYNONYM
- ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW for information on revalidating invalid materialized views
## CASCADE CONSTRAINTS
Specify `CASCADE` `CONSTRAINTS` to drop all referential integrity constraints that refer to primary and unique keys in the view to be dropped. If you omit this clause, and such constraints exist, then the `DROP` statement fails.
## Examples
**Dropping a View: Example**
The following statement drops the `emp_view` view, which was created in “Creating a View: Example”:
```
DROP VIEW emp_view;
```
