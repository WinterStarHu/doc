## Purpose
`PREDICTION_BOUNDS` applies a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to predict a class or a value for each row in the selection. The function returns the upper and lower bounds of each prediction in a varray of objects with fields `UPPER` and `LOWER`.
GLM can perform either regression or binary classification:
````
- The bounds for regression refer to the predicted target value. The data type of UPPER and LOWER is the data type of the target.
**``````
- The bounds for binary classification refer to the probability of either the predicted target class or the specified class_value. The data type of UPPER and LOWER is BINARY_DOUBLE.
If the model was built using ridge regression, or if the covariance matrix is found to be singular during the build, then `PREDICTION_BOUNDS` returns `NULL` for both bounds.
*confidence_level* is a number in the range (0,1). The default value is
0.95. You can specify *class_value* while leaving *confidence_level* at its default by specifying `NULL` for *confidence_level*.
The syntax of the `PREDICTION_BOUNDS` function can use an optional `GROUPING` hint when scoring a partitioned model. See GROUPING Hint.
## mining_attribute_clause
*mining_attribute_clause* identifies the column attributes to use as predictors for scoring. This clause behaves as described for the `PREDICTION` function. (Note that the reference to analytic syntax does not apply.) See “mining_attribute_clause::=”.

## Example
The following example returns the distribution of customers whose ages are predicted with 98% confidence to be greater than 24 and less than 46.
```
SELECT count(cust_id) cust_count, cust_marital_status
  FROM (SELECT cust_id, cust_marital_status
    FROM mining_data_apply_v
    WHERE PREDICTION_BOUNDS(glmr_sh_regr_sample,0.98 USING *).LOWER > 24 AND
          PREDICTION_BOUNDS(glmr_sh_regr_sample,0.98 USING *).UPPER < 46)
    GROUP BY cust_marital_status;
