In addition to the schema of a user, *schema* can also be “`PUBLIC`” (double quotation marks required), in which case it must qualify a public synonym for a table, view, or materialized view. Qualifying a public synonym with “`PUBLIC`” is supported only in data manipulation language (DML) statements, not data definition language (DDL) statements.
You can specify `ROWID` only with a table, not with a view or materialized view. `NCHAR` and `NVARCHAR2` are not valid pseudocolumn data types.
**See Also:**   Pseudocolumns for more information on pseudocolumns and *subquery_factoring_clause* for information on *query_name*
Some valid simple expressions are:
```
employees.last_name
'this is a text string'
10
N'this is an NCHAR string'
```
