# DROP ROLE

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `ROLE` statement to remove a role from the database. When you drop a role, Oracle Database revokes it from all users and roles to whom it has been granted and removes it from the database. User sessions in which the role is already enabled are not affected. However, no new user session can enable the role after it is dropped.
**See Also:**
- CREATE ROLE and ALTER ROLE for information on creating roles and changing the authorization needed to enable a role
- SET ROLE for information on disabling roles for the current session
## Prerequisites
You must have been granted the role with the `ADMIN` `OPTION` or you must have the `DROP` `ANY` `ROLE` system privilege.
## Syntax
