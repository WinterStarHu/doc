# Set Operators

Set operators combine the results of two component queries into a single result. Queries containing set operators are called compound queries. Table 4-5 lists SQL set operators. They are fully described, including examples and restrictions on these operators, in The UNION [ALL], INTERSECT, MINUS Operators.
