# SUBSTR

## Syntax
## *substr*::=

## Purpose
The `SUBSTR` functions return a portion of *char*, beginning at character *position*, *substring_length* characters long. `SUBSTR` calculates lengths using characters as defined by the input character set. `SUBSTRB` uses bytes instead of characters. `SUBSTRC` uses Unicode complete characters. `SUBSTR2` uses UCS2 code points. `SUBSTR4` uses UCS4 code points.
**
- If position is 0, then it is treated as 1.
****
- If position is positive, then Oracle Database counts from the beginning of char to find the first character.
****
- If position is negative, then Oracle counts backward from the end of char.
******
- If substring_length is omitted, then Oracle returns all characters to the end of char. If substring_length is less than 1, then Oracle returns null.
*char* can be any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, or `NCLOB`. The exceptions are `SUBSTRC`, `SUBSTR2`, and `SUBSTR4`, which do not allow *char* to be a `CLOB` or `NCLOB`. Both *position* and *substring_length* must be of data type `NUMBER`, or any data type that can be implicitly converted to `NUMBER`, and must resolve to an integer. The return value is the same data type as *char*, except that for a `CHAR` argument a `VARCHAR2` value is returned, and for an `NCHAR` argument an `NVARCHAR2` value is returned. Floating-point numbers passed as arguments to `SUBSTR` are automatically converted to integers.

## Examples
The following example returns several specified substrings of “ABCDEFG”:
```
SELECT SUBSTR('ABCDEFG',3,4) "Substring"
     FROM DUAL;
Substring
---------
CDEF
SELECT SUBSTR('ABCDEFG',-5,4) "Substring"
     FROM DUAL;
Substring
---------
CDEF
```
Assume a double-byte database character set:
```
SELECT SUBSTRB('ABCDEFG',5,4.2) "Substring with bytes"
     FROM DUAL;
Substring with bytes
--------------------
CD
```
