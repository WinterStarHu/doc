# CREATE PACKAGE BODY

## Purpose
Package bodies are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, this section provides some general information but refers to *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for details of syntax and semantics.
Use the `CREATE` `PACKAGE` `BODY` statement to create the body of a stored **package**, which is an encapsulated collection of related procedures, stored functions, and other program objects stored together in the database. The **package body** defines these objects. The **package** **specification**, defined in an earlier `CREATE` `PACKAGE` statement, declares these objects.
Packages are an alternative to creating procedures and functions as standalone schema objects.
**See Also:**
- CREATE FUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE for information on creating standalone functions and procedures
- CREATE PACKAGE for a discussion of packages, including how to create packages
- ALTER PACKAGE for information on modifying a package
- DROP PACKAGE for information on removing a package from the database
## Prerequisites
To create or replace a package in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` system privilege. To create or replace a package in another user’s schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANY` `PROCEDURE` system privilege. In both cases, the package body must be created in the same schema as the package.
To embed a `CREATE` `PACKAGE` `BODY` statement inside an Oracle Database precompiler program, you must terminate the statement with the keyword `END-EXEC` followed by the embedded SQL statement terminator for the specific language.

## Syntax
Package bodies are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, the syntax diagram in this book shows only the SQL keywords. Refer to *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for the PL/SQL syntax, semantics, and examples.

## Semantics
## OR REPLACE
Specify `OR` `REPLACE` to re-create the package body if it already exists. Use this clause to change the body of an existing package without dropping, re-creating, and regranting object privileges previously granted on it. If you change a package body, then Oracle Database recompiles it.
Users who had previously been granted privileges on a redefined package can still access the package without being regranted the privileges.
**See Also:**   ALTER PACKAGE for information on recompiling package bodies
## IF NOT EXISTS
Specifying `IF NOT EXISTS` has the following effects:
- If the package body does not exist, a new one is created at the end of the statement.
- If the package body exists, it is detected and a new one is not created.
You can only specify `OR REPLACE` or `IF NOT EXISTS` in a statement at a time. Using both `OR REPLACE` with `IF NOT EXISTS` in the very same statement results in an error.
You cannot specify `IF EXISTS` with `CREATE` statements.
**Note:**   You can use `IF [NOT] EXISTS` only from Release 19.28 and up.
## [ EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE ]
If you do not specify this clause, then the package body inherits `EDITIONABLE` or `NONEDITIONABLE` from the package specification. If you do specify this clause, then it must match that of the package specification.
