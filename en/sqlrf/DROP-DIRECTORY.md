# DROP DIRECTORY

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `DIRECTORY` statement to remove a directory object from the database.
**See Also:**   CREATE DIRECTORY for information on creating a directory
## Prerequisites
To drop a directory, you must have the `DROP` `ANY` `DIRECTORY` system privilege.
**Note:**   Do not drop a directory when files in the associated file system are being accessed by PL/SQL or OCI programs.
## Syntax
## *drop_directory*::=
Description of the illustration drop_directory.eps
## Semantics
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to drop an existing directory.
**Note:**   You can only use `IF EXISTS` from Release 19.28 and up.
## *directory_name*
Specify the name of the directory database object to be dropped.
Oracle Database removes the directory object but does not delete the associated operating system directory on the server file system.
## Examples
