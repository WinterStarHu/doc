# ALTER PACKAGE

## Purpose
Packages are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, this section provides some general information but refers to *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for details of syntax and semantics.
Use the `ALTER` `PACKAGE` statement to explicitly recompile a package specification, body, or both. Explicit recompilation eliminates the need for implicit run-time recompilation and prevents associated run-time compilation errors and performance overhead.
Because all objects in a package are stored as a unit, the `ALTER` `PACKAGE` statement recompiles all package objects together. You cannot use the `ALTER` `PROCEDURE` statement or `ALTER` `FUNCTION` statement to recompile individually a procedure or function that is part of a package.
**Note:**   This statement does not change the declaration or definition of an existing package. To redeclare or redefine a package, use the CREATE PACKAGE or the CREATE PACKAGE BODY statement with the `OR` `REPLACE` clause.
## Prerequisites
For you to modify a package, the package must be in your own schema or you must have `ALTER` `ANY` `PROCEDURE` system privilege.
## Syntax
## *alter_package*::=
Description of the illustration alter_package.eps
(*package_compile_clause*: See *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for the syntax of this clause.)
## Semantics
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to alter an existing package.
**Note:**   You can only use `IF EXISTS` from Release 19.28 and up.
## *schema*
Specify the schema containing the package. If you omit *schema*, then Oracle Database assumes the package is in your own schema.
## *package_name*
Specify the name of the package to be recompiled.
## *package_compile_clause*
See *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for the syntax and semantics of this clause and for complete information on creating and compiling packages.
## EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE
Use these clauses to specify whether the package becomes an editioned or noneditioned object if editioning is later enabled for the schema object type `PACKAGE` in *schema*. The default is `EDITIONABLE`. For information about altering editioned and noneditioned objects, see *Oracle Database Development Guide*.
