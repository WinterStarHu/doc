## Purpose
`FLOOR` returns the largest integer equal to or less than *n*. The number *n* can always be written as the sum of an integer *k* and a positive fraction *f* such that 0 <= *f* < 1 and *n* = *k* + *f*. The value of `FLOOR` is the integer *k*. Thus, the value of `FLOOR` is *n* itself if and only if *n* is precisely an integer.
This function takes as an argument any numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. The function returns the same data type as the numeric data type of the argument.

## Examples
The following example returns the largest integer equal to or less than 15.7:
```
SELECT FLOOR(15.7) "Floor"
  FROM DUAL;
     Floor
----------
        15
```
