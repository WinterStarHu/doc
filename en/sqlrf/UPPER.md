## Purpose
`UPPER` returns *char*, with all letters uppercase. *char* can be any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, or `NCLOB`. The return value is the same data type as *char*. The database sets the case of the characters based on the binary mapping defined for the underlying character set. For linguistic-sensitive uppercase, refer to NLS_UPPER.
**See Also:**   in *Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide* for the collation derivation rules, which define the collation assigned to the character return value of `UPPER`
## Examples
The following example returns each employee’s last name in uppercase:
```
SELECT UPPER(last_name) "Uppercase"
   FROM employees;
```
