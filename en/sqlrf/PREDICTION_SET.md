## Purpose
`PREDICTION_SET` returns a set of predictions with either probabilities or costs for each row in the selection. The return value is a varray of objects with field names `PREDICTION_ID` and `PROBABILITY` or `COST`. The prediction identifier has the data type of the target. The probability and cost fields are `BINARY_DOUBLE`.
`PREDICTION_SET` can perform classification or anomaly detection. For classification, the return value refers to a predicted target class. For anomaly detection, the return value refers to a classification of `1` (for typical rows) or `0` (for anomalous rows).
## bestN and cutoff
You can specify *bestN* and *cutoff* to limit the number of predictions returned by the function. By default, both *bestN* and *cutoff* are null and all predictions are returned.
******
- bestN is the N predictions that are either the most probable or the least costly. If multiple predictions share the Nth probability or cost, then the function chooses one of them.
**************
- cutoff is a value threshold. Only predictions with probability greater than or equal to cutoff, or with cost less than or equal to cutoff, are returned. To filter by cutoff only, specify NULL for bestN. If the function uses a cost_matrix_clause with COST MODEL AUTO, then cutoff is ignored.
You can specify *bestN* with *cutoff* to return up to the *N* most probable predictions that are greater than or equal to *cutoff*. If costs are used, specify *bestN* with *cutoff* to return up to the *N* least costly predictions that are less than or equal to cutoff.
## cost_matrix_clause
You can specify *cost_matrix_clause* as a biasing factor for minimizing the most harmful kinds of misclassifications. *cost_matrix_clause* behaves as described for “PREDICTION_COST”.
## Syntax Choice
`PREDICTION_SET` can score the data in one of two ways: It can apply a mining model object to the data, or it can dynamically mine the data by executing an analytic clause that builds and applies one or more transient mining models. Choose **Syntax** or **Analytic Syntax**:
****
- Syntax — Use the first syntax to score the data with a pre-defined model. Supply the name of a model that performs classification or anomaly detection.
************
****
  - For classification, specify FOR expr, where expr is an expression that identifies a target column that has a character data type.
  - For anomaly detection, specify the keywords OF ANOMALY.
The syntax of the `PREDICTION_SET` function can use an optional `GROUPING` hint when scoring a partitioned model. See GROUPING Hint.
## mining_attribute_clause
*mining_attribute_clause* identifies the column attributes to use as predictors for scoring. When the function is invoked with the analytic syntax, these predictors are also used for building the transient models. The *mining_attribute_clause* behaves as described for the `PREDICTION` function. (See “mining_attribute_clause::=”.)

## Example
This example lists the probability and cost that customers with ID less than 100006 will use an affinity card. This example has a binary target, but such a query is also useful for multiclass classification such as low, medium, and high.
```

  FROM (SELECT cust_id,
               PREDICTION_SET(dt_sh_clas_sample COST MODEL USING *) pset

         WHERE cust_id < 100006) T,
       TABLE(T.pset) S
ORDER BY cust_id, S.prediction;
