# ALTER PROCEDURE

## Purpose
Packages are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, this section provides some general information but refers to *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for details of syntax and semantics.
Use the `ALTER` `PROCEDURE` statement to explicitly recompile a standalone stored procedure. Explicit recompilation eliminates the need for implicit run-time recompilation and prevents associated run-time compilation errors and performance overhead.
To recompile a procedure that is part of a package, recompile the entire package using the `ALTER` `PACKAGE` statement (see ALTER PACKAGE).
**Note:**   This statement does not change the declaration or definition of an existing procedure. To redeclare or redefine a procedure, use the `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` statement with the `OR` `REPLACE` clause (see CREATE PROCEDURE).
The `ALTER` `PROCEDURE` statement is quite similar to the `ALTER` `FUNCTION` statement. Refer to ALTER FUNCTION for more information.
## Prerequisites
The procedure must be in your own schema or you must have `ALTER` `ANY` `PROCEDURE` system privilege.
## Syntax
## *alter_procedure*::=
Description of the illustration alter_procedure.eps
(*procedure_compile_clause*: See *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for the syntax of this clause.)
## Semantics
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to alter an existing procedure.
**Note:**   You can only use `IF EXISTS` from Release 19.28 and up.
## *schema*
Specify the schema containing the procedure. If you omit *schema*, then Oracle Database assumes the procedure is in your own schema.
## *procedure_name*
Specify the name of the procedure to be recompiled.
## *procedure_compile_clause*
See *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for the syntax and semantics of this clause and for complete information on creating and compiling procedures.
## EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE
Use these clauses to specify whether the procedure becomes an editioned or noneditioned object if editioning is later enabled for the schema object type `PROCEDURE` in *schema*. The default is `EDITIONABLE`. For information about altering editioned and noneditioned objects, see *Oracle Database Development Guide*.
