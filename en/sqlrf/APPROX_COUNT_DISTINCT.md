## Purpose
`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` returns the approximate number of rows that contain a distinct value for *expr*.
This function provides an alternative to the `COUNT` `(DISTINCT` *expr*`)` function, which returns the exact number of rows that contain distinct values of *expr*. `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` processes large amounts of data significantly faster than `COUNT`, with negligible deviation from the exact result.
For *expr*, you can specify a column of any scalar data type other than `BFILE`, `BLOB`, `CLOB`, `LONG`, `LONG` `RAW`, or `NCLOB`.
`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` ignores rows that contain a null value for *expr*. This function returns a `NUMBER`.

## Examples
The following statement returns the approximate number of rows with distinct values for `manager_id`:
```
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(manager_id) AS "Active Managers"
  FROM employees;
Active Managers
---------------
             18
```
The following statement returns the approximate number of distinct customers for each product:
```
SELECT prod_id, APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(cust_id) AS "Number of Customers"
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY prod_id
  ORDER BY prod_id;
   PROD_ID Number of Customers
