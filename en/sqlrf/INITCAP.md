## Purpose
`INITCAP` returns *char*, with the first letter of each word in uppercase, all other letters in lowercase. Words are delimited by white space or characters that are not alphanumeric.
*char* can be of any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, or `NVARCHAR2`. The return value is the same data type as *char*. The database sets the case of the initial characters based on the binary mapping defined for the underlying character set. For linguistic-sensitive uppercase and lowercase, refer to NLS_INITCAP.
This function does not support `CLOB` data directly. However, `CLOB`s can be passed in as arguments through implicit data conversion.

## Examples
The following example capitalizes each word in the string:
```
SELECT INITCAP('the soap') "Capitals"
  FROM DUAL;
Capitals
---------
The Soap
```
