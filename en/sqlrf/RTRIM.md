## Purpose
`RTRIM` removes from the right end of *char* all of the characters that appear in *set*. This function is useful for formatting the output of a query.
If you do not specify *set*, then it defaults to a single blank. `RTRIM` works similarly to `LTRIM`.
Both *char* and *set* can be any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, or `NCLOB`. The string returned is of `VARCHAR2` data type if *char* is a character data type, `NVARCHAR2` if *char* is a national character data type, and a LOB if *char* is a LOB data type.

## Examples
The following example trims all the right-most occurrences of less than sign (`<`), greater than sign (`>`) , and equal sign (`=`) from a string:
```
SELECT RTRIM('<=====>BROWNING<=====>', '<>=') "RTRIM Example"
  FROM DUAL;
RTRIM Example
---------------
<=====>BROWNING
```
