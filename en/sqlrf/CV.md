# CV

## Syntax
Description of the illustration cv.gif
Description of the illustration cv.eps
## Purpose
The `CV` function can be used only in the *model_clause* of a `SELECT` statement and then only on the right-hand side of a model rule. It returns the current value of a dimension column or a partitioning column carried from the left-hand side to the right-hand side of a rule. This function is used in the *model_clause* to provide relative indexing with respect to the dimension column. The return type is that of the data type of the dimension column. If you omit the argument, then it defaults to the dimension column associated with the relative position of the function within the cell reference.
The `CV` function can be used outside a cell reference. In this case, *dimension_column* is required.

- in Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide for the collation derivation rules, which define the collation assigned to the return value of CV when it is a character value
## Examples
The following example assigns the sum of the sales of the product represented by the current value of the dimension column (Mouse Pad or Standard Mouse) for years 1999 and 2000 to the sales of that product for year 2001:
```
SELECT country, prod, year, s
  FROM sales_view_ref
  MODEL
    PARTITION BY (country)
    DIMENSION BY (prod, year)
    MEASURES (sale s)
    IGNORE NAV
    UNIQUE DIMENSION
    RULES UPSERT SEQUENTIAL ORDER
    (
      s[FOR prod IN ('Mouse Pad', 'Standard Mouse'), 2001] =
        s[CV( ), 1999] + s[CV( ), 2000]
    )
  ORDER BY country, prod, year;
COUNTRY       PROD                                         YEAR           S
