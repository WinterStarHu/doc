# About SQL Functions

SQL functions are built into Oracle Database and are available for use in various appropriate SQL statements. Do not confuse SQL functions with user-defined functions written in PL/SQL.
If you call a SQL function with an argument of a data type other than the data type expected by the SQL function, then Oracle attempts to convert the argument to the expected data type before performing the SQL function.

## Nulls in SQL Functions
Most scalar functions return null when given a null argument. You can use the `NVL` function to return a value when a null occurs. For example, the expression `NVL(commission_pct,0)` returns 0 if `commission_pct` is null or the value of `commission_pct` if it is not null.
For information on how aggregate functions handle nulls, see Aggregate Functions.
## Syntax for SQL Functions
In the syntax diagrams for SQL functions, arguments are indicated by their data types. When the parameter *function* appears in SQL syntax, replace it with one of the functions described in this section. Functions are grouped by the data types of their arguments and their return values.
**Note:**   When you apply SQL functions to LOB columns, Oracle Database creates temporary LOBs during SQL and PL/SQL processing. You should ensure that temporary tablespace quota is sufficient for storing these temporary LOBs for your application.
A SQL function may be collation-sensitive, which means that character value comparison or matching that it performs is controlled by a collation. The particular collation to use by the function is determined from the collations of the function’s arguments.
If the result of a SQL function has a character data type, the collation derivation rules define the collation to associate with the result.
**See Also:**   in *Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide* for the collation derivation and determination rules for SQL functions
The syntax showing the categories of functions follows:

The sections that follow list the built-in SQL functions in each of the groups illustrated in the preceding diagrams except user-defined functions. All of the built-in SQL functions are then described in alphabetical order.
