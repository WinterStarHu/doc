# DROP EDITION

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `EDITION` statement to drop an edition, along with all actual editionable objects it contains. An actual editionable object is an editionable object that has been created or modified in an edition.
**See Also:**   CREATE EDITION for a listing of editionable object types
## Prerequisites
You must have the `DROP` `ANY` `EDITION` system privilege, granted either directly or through a role.
## Syntax
## *drop_edition*::=
Description of the illustration drop_edition.eps
## Semantics
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to drop an existing edition.
**Note:**   You can only use `IF EXISTS` from Release 19.28 and up.
Objects that are not editionable, or that are editionable but have not been actualized in the current edition, are not dropped.
You must specify `CASCADE` if the specified edition contains any actual editionable objects.
This statement is subject to the following conditions and restrictions:
- The specified edition cannot have both a parent edition and a child edition.
````
- DROP EDITION will fail if you attempt to drop the default edition.

- DROP EDITION will fail if you attempt to drop the root edition and the recycle bin contains at least one object that used to be in that edition before it was dropped. Under these circumstances, even DROP EDITION CASCADE will fail. In this case, you can purge all objects from the recycle bin with the PURGE DBA_RECYCLEBIN statement and then drop the edition. Refer to PURGE for more information. DROP EDITION will also fail if you attempt to drop the leaf edition and the recycle bin contains at least one object that used to be in that edition before it was dropped. However, under these circumstances, DROP EDITION CASCADE will succeed. The only type of editioned object that might be in the recycle bin is a trigger.
## Examples
For examples that use this statement, refer to CREATE EDITION.
