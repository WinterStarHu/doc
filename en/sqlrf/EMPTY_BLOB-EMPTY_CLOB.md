## Purpose
`EMPTY_BLOB` and `EMPTY_CLOB` return an empty LOB locator that can be used to initialize a LOB variable or, in an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement, to initialize a LOB column or attribute to `EMPTY`. `EMPTY` means that the LOB is initialized, but not populated with data.
**Note:**   An empty LOB is not the same as a null LOB, and an empty `CLOB` is not the same as a LOB containing a string of 0 length. For more information, see *Oracle Database SecureFiles and Large Objects Developer’s Guide*.
**See Also:**   in *Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide* for the collation derivation rules, which define the collation assigned to the return value of `EMPTY_CLOB`
## Restriction on LOB Locators
You cannot use the locator returned from this function as a parameter to the `DBMS_LOB` package or the OCI.
## Examples
The following example initializes the `ad_photo` column of the sample `pm.print_media` table to `EMPTY`:
```
UPDATE print_media
  SET ad_photo = EMPTY_BLOB();
```
