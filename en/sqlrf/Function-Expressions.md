# Function Expressions

You can use any built-in SQL function or user-defined function as an expression. Some valid built-in function expressions are:
```
LENGTH('BLAKE')
ROUND(1234.567*43)
SYSDATE
```
**See Also:**   About SQL Functions’ and Aggregate Functions for information on built-in functions
A user-defined function expression specifies a call to:
**
- A function in an Oracle-supplied package (see Oracle Database PL/SQL Packages and Types Reference)
- A function in a user-defined package or type or in a standalone user-defined function (see About User-Defined Functions)
**
- A user-defined function or operator (see CREATE OPERATOR, CREATE FUNCTION, and Oracle Database Data Cartridge Developer’s Guide)
Some valid user-defined function expressions are:
```
circle_area(radius)
payroll.tax_rate(empno)
hr.employees.comm_pct@remote(dependents, empno)
DBMS_LOB.getlength(column_name)
my_function(a_column)
```
In a user-defined function being used as an expression, positional, named, and mixed notation are supported. For example, all of the following notations are correct:
```
CALL my_function(arg1 => 3, arg2 => 4) ...
```
```
CALL my_function(3, 4) ...
CALL my_function(3, arg2 => 4) ...
```
## Restriction on User-Defined Function Expressions
You cannot pass arguments of object type or `XMLType` to remote functions and procedures.
