## Purpose
`FEATURE_ID` returns the identifier of the highest value feature for each row in the selection. The feature identifier is returned as an Oracle `NUMBER`.
## Syntax Choice
`FEATURE_ID` can score the data in one of two ways: It can apply a mining model object to the data, or it can dynamically mine the data by executing an analytic clause that builds and applies one or more transient mining models. Choose **Syntax** or **Analytic Syntax**:
****
- Syntax — Use the first syntax to score the data with a pre-defined model. Supply the name of a feature extraction model.
****************
- Analytic Syntax — Use the analytic syntax to score the data without a pre-defined model. Include INTO n, where n is the number of features to extract, and mining_analytic_clause, which specifies if the data should be partitioned for multiple model builds. The mining_analytic_clause supports a query_partition_clause and an order_by_clause. (See “analytic_clause::=”.)
The syntax of the `FEATURE_ID` function can use an optional `GROUPING` hint when scoring a partitioned model. See GROUPING Hint.
## mining_attribute_clause
*mining_attribute_clause* identifies the column attributes to use as predictors for scoring. When the function is invoked with the analytic syntax, these predictors are also used for building the transient models. The *mining_attribute_clause* behaves as described for the `PREDICTION` function. (See “mining_attribute_clause::=”.)

## Example
This example lists the features and corresponding count of customers in a data set.
```
SELECT FEATURE_ID(nmf_sh_sample USING *) AS feat, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM nmf_sh_sample_apply_prepared
  GROUP BY FEATURE_ID(nmf_sh_sample USING *)
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, feat DESC;
      FEAT        CNT
---------- ----------

         2         49
         3          6
         6          1
         1          1
