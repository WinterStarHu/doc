## Purpose
`LOWER` returns *char*, with all letters lowercase. *char* can be any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, or `NCLOB`. The return value is the same data type as *char*. The database sets the case of the characters based on the binary mapping defined for the underlying character set. For linguistic-sensitive lowercase, refer to NLS_LOWER.
**See Also:**   in *Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide* for the collation derivation rules, which define the collation assigned to the character return value of `LOWER`
## Examples
The following example returns a string in lowercase:
```
SELECT LOWER('MR. SCOTT MCMILLAN') "Lowercase"
  FROM DUAL;
Lowercase
--------------------
mr. scott mcmillan
```
