# CREATE PACKAGE

## Purpose
Packages are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, this section provides some general information but refers to *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for details of syntax and semantics.
Use the `CREATE` `PACKAGE` statement to create the specification for a stored **package**, which is an encapsulated collection of related procedures, functions, and other program objects stored together in the database. The **package specification** declares these objects. The **package** **body**, specified subsequently, defines these objects.
**See Also:**
- CREATE PACKAGE BODY for information on specifying the implementation of the package
- CREATE FUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE for information on creating standalone functions and procedures
- ALTER PACKAGE and DROP PACKAGE for information on modifying and dropping a package

- Oracle Database Development Guide and Oracle Database PL/SQL Packages and Types Reference for detailed discussions of packages and how to use them
## Prerequisites
To create or replace a package in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` system privilege. To create or replace a package in another user’s schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANY` `PROCEDURE` system privilege.
To embed a `CREATE` `PACKAGE` statement inside an Oracle Database precompiler program, you must terminate the statement with the keyword `END-EXEC` followed by the embedded SQL statement terminator for the specific language.

## Syntax
Packages are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, the syntax diagram in this book shows only the SQL keywords. Refer to *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for the PL/SQL syntax, semantics, and examples.

## Semantics
## OR REPLACE
Specify `OR` `REPLACE` to re-create the package specification if it already exists. Use this clause to change the specification of an existing package without dropping, re-creating, and regranting object privileges previously granted on the package. If you change a package specification, then Oracle Database recompiles it.
Users who had previously been granted privileges on a redefined package can still access the package without being regranted the privileges.
If any function-based indexes depend on the package, then the database marks the indexes `DISABLED`.
**See Also:**    `ALTER` `PACKAGE` for information on recompiling package specifications
## IF NOT EXISTS
Specifying `IF NOT EXISTS` has the following effects:
- If the package does not exist, a new one is created at the end of the statement.
- If the package exists, it is detected and a new one is not created.
You can only specify `OR REPLACE` or `IF NOT EXISTS` in a statement at a time. Using both `OR REPLACE` with `IF NOT EXISTS` in the very same statement results in an error.
You cannot specify `IF EXISTS` with `CREATE` statements.
**Note:**   You can use `IF [NOT] EXISTS` only from Release 19.28 and up.
## [ EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE ]
Use these clauses to specify whether the package is an editioned or noneditioned object if editioning is enabled for the schema object type `PACKAGE` in *schema*. The default is `EDITIONABLE`. For information about editioned and noneditioned objects, see *Oracle Database Development Guide*.
## *plsql_package_source*
See *Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference* for the syntax and semantics of the *plsql_package_source*, including examples.
