# DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `MATERIALIZED` `VIEW` `LOG` statement to remove a materialized view log from the database.
**Note:**   The keyword `SNAPSHOT` is supported in place of `MATERIALIZED` `VIEW` for backward compatibility.
**See Also:**
- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW and ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW for more information on materialized views
- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG for information on materialized view logs

- Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide for information on materialized views in a data warehousing environment
## Prerequisites
To drop a materialized view log, you must have the privileges needed to drop a table.
**See Also:**   DROP TABLE
## Syntax
## *drop_materialized_view_log*::=
Description of the illustration drop_materialized_view_log.eps
## Semantics
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to drop an existing materialized view log.
## *schema*
Specify the schema containing the materialized view log and its master table. If you omit *schema*, then Oracle Database assumes the materialized view log and master table are in your own schema.
## *table*
Specify the name of the master table associated with the materialized view log to be dropped.
After you drop a materialized view log that was created `FOR` `FAST` `REFRESH`, some materialized views based on the materialized view log master table can no longer be fast refreshed. These materialized views include rowid materialized views, primary key materialized views, and subquery materialized views.
**See Also:**    *Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide* for a description of these types of materialized views
After you drop a materialized view log that was created `FOR` `SYNCHRONOUS` `REFRESH` (a staging log), the materialized views based on the staging log master table can no longer be synchronous refreshed.
## Examples
**Dropping a Materialized View Log: Example**
The following statement drops the materialized view log on the `oe.customers` master table:
```
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON customers;
```
