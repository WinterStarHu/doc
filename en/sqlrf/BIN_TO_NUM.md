## Purpose
`BIN_TO_NUM` converts a bit vector to its equivalent number. Each argument to this function represents a bit in the bit vector. This function takes as arguments any numeric data type, or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to `NUMBER`. Each *expr* must evaluate to 0 or 1. This function returns Oracle `NUMBER`.
`BIN_TO_NUM` is useful in data warehousing applications for selecting groups of interest from a materialized view using grouping sets.

## Examples
The following example converts a binary value to a number:
```
SELECT BIN_TO_NUM(1,0,1,0)
  FROM DUAL;
BIN_TO_NUM(1,0,1,0)
-------------------
                 10
```
The next example converts three values into a single binary value and uses `BIN_TO_NUM` to convert that binary into a number. The example uses a PL/SQL declaration to specify the original values. These would normally be derived from actual data sources.
```
SELECT order_status
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_id = 2441;
ORDER_STATUS
------------
           5
DECLARE
  warehouse NUMBER := 1;
  ground    NUMBER := 1;
  insured   NUMBER := 1;
  result    NUMBER;
BEGIN
  SELECT BIN_TO_NUM(warehouse, ground, insured) INTO result FROM DUAL;
  UPDATE orders SET order_status = result WHERE order_id = 2441;
END;
/
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
SELECT order_status
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_id = 2441;
ORDER_STATUS
------------
           7
```
