# Selecting Table Data

**Note:**   To complete the tutorials and examples in this section, you must be connected to Oracle Database as the user HR from SQL Developer. For instructions, see “Connecting to Oracle Database as User HR from SQL Developer”.
## About Queries
A **query**, or SQL SELECT statement, selects data from one or more tables or views.
The simplest form of query has the following syntax:
```
SELECT select_list FROM source_list
```
The select_list value specifies the columns from which the data is to be selected, and the source_list value specifies the tables or views that have these columns.
A query nested within another SQL statement is called a **subquery**.
In the SQL*Plus environment, you can enter a query (or any other SQL statement) after the SQL> prompt.
In the SQL Developer environment, you can enter a query (or any other SQL statement) in the Worksheet.
**Note:**   When the result of a query is displayed, records can be in any order, unless you specify their order with the ORDER BY clause. For more information, see “Sorting Selected Data”.

## Running Queries in SQL Developer
This section explains how to run queries in SQL Developer, using the Worksheet.
**Note:**   The Worksheet is not limited to queries; you can use it to run any SQL statement.
**Steps to run queries in SQL Developer:**
****
  - If the Worksheet subpane does not show, select the Worksheet tab.
  - Go to step 4.
****
- Select the SQL Worksheet icon.
  - If the Connection field does not have the value hr_conn, select that value from the menu.
****
  - Select OK.
A pane is displayed with a tab labeled hr_conn and two subpanes, Worksheet and Query Builder. In the Worksheet, you can enter a SQL statement.
  - In the Worksheet, type a query (a SELECT statement).
****
- Click the icon Run Statement. The query runs. Under the Worksheet, the Query Result pane appears, showing the query result.
****
- Under the hr_conn tab, click the Clear icon. The query disappears, and you can enter another SQL statement in the Worksheet. When you run another SQL statement, its result appears in the Query Result pane, replacing the result of the previously run SQL statement.
**See Also:**   *Oracle SQL Developer User’s Guide* for information about using the Worksheet in SQL Developer
## Tutorial: Selecting All Columns of a Table
This tutorial shows how to select all columns of the EMPLOYEES table.
**Steps to select all columns of the EMPLOYEES Table:**
****
- If a pane with the tab hr_conn is displayed, select it. Otherwise, click the SQL Worksheet icon, as in “Running Queries in SQL Developer”.
- In the Worksheet, enter the following query: SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES;
****
- Click the Run Statement icon. The query runs. Under the Worksheet, the Query Result pane appears, showing all columns of the EMPLOYEES table.
**Caution:**   Be very careful about using SELECT * on tables with columns that store sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card information.
**See Also:**   “Tutorial: Viewing EMPLOYEES Table Properties and Data with SQL Developer” for information about another way to view table data with SQL Developer
## Tutorial: Selecting Specific Columns of a Table
This tutorial shows how to select only the columns FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, and DEPARTMENT_ID of the EMPLOYEES table.
**Steps to select only FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, and DEPARTMENT_ID:**
- If a pane with the tab hr_conn is displayed, select it. Otherwise, click the SQL Worksheet icon, as in “Running Queries in SQL Developer.”
****
- If the Worksheet pane contains a query, clear the query by selecting the Clear icon.
- In the Worksheet, enter the following query: SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID FROM EMPLOYEES;
****
- Click the Run Statement icon. The query runs. Under the Worksheet, the Query Result pane is displayed, showing the results of the query, which are similar to the following text.
```

## Displaying Selected Columns Under New Headings
In displayed query results, default column headings are column names. To display a column under a new heading, specify the new heading (**alias**) immediately after the column name. The alias renames the column for the duration of the query, but does not change its name in the database.
The query in Example 2-5 selects the same columns as the query in “Tutorial: Selecting Specific Columns of a Table”, but it also specifies aliases for them. Because the aliases are not enclosed in double quotation marks, they are displayed in uppercase letters.
If you enclose column aliases in double quotation marks, case is preserved, and the aliases can include spaces, as in Example 2-6.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about the SELECT statement, including the column alias (c_alias)
**Example 2-5 Displaying Selected Columns Under New Headings**
```
SELECT FIRST_NAME First, LAST_NAME last, DEPARTMENT_ID DepT
FROM EMPLOYEES;
```
The result is similar to the following text:

## Selecting Data that Satisfies Specified Conditions
To select only data that matches a specified condition, include the WHERE clause in the SELECT statement.
The condition in the WHERE clause can be any SQL condition (for information about SQL conditions, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*).
The query in Example 2-7 selects data only for employees in department 90.
To select data only for employees in departments 100, 110, and 120, use the following WHERE clause:
```
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IN (100, 110, 120);
```
The query in Example 2-8 selects data only for employees whose last names start with “Ma”.
To select data only for employees whose last names include “ma”, use the following WHERE clause:
```
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE '%ma%';
```
The query in Example 2-9 tests for two conditions—whether the salary is at least 11000, and whether the commission percentage is not null.
**See Also:**
**

**
- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for more information about SQL conditions
**Example 2-7 Selecting Data from One Department**
```
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 90;
```
The result is similar to the following text:
```
FIRST_NAME           LAST_NAME                 DEPARTMENT_ID
-------------------- ------------------------- -------------
Steven               King                                 90

6 rows selected.
```
## Sorting Selected Data
When query results are displayed, records can be in any order, unless you specify their order with the ORDER BY clause.
The query results in Example 2-10 are sorted by `LAST_NAME`, in ascending order (the default).
Alternatively, in SQL Developer, you can omit the ORDER BY clause and double-click the name of the column to sort.
The sort criterion need not be included in the select list, as Example 2-11 shows.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about the SELECT statement, including the ORDER BY clause
**Example 2-10 Sorting Selected Data by LAST_NAME**
```
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, HIRE_DATE
FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY LAST_NAME;
```
Result:
```
FIRST_NAME           LAST_NAME                 HIRE_DATE

## Selecting Data from Multiple Tables
To select data from multiple tables, you use a query that is called a **join**. The tables in a join must share at least one column name.
Suppose that you want to select the FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, and DEPARTMENT_NAME of every employee. FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME are in the EMPLOYEES table, and DEPARTMENT_NAME is in the DEPARTMENTS table. Both tables have DEPARTMENT_ID. You can use the query in Example 2-12.
Table-name qualifiers are optional for column names that appear in only one table of a join, but are required for column names that appear in both tables. The following query is equivalent to the query in Example 2-12:
```
SELECT FIRST_NAME "First",
LAST_NAME "Last",
DEPARTMENT_NAME "Dept. Name"
FROM EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS
WHERE EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID = DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID
ORDER BY DEPARTMENT_NAME, LAST_NAME;
```
To make queries that use qualified column names more readable, use table aliases, as shown in the following example:
```
SELECT FIRST_NAME "First",
LAST_NAME "Last",
DEPARTMENT_NAME "Dept. Name"
FROM EMPLOYEES e, DEPARTMENTS d
WHERE e.DEPARTMENT_ID = d.DEPARTMENT_ID
ORDER BY d.DEPARTMENT_NAME, e.LAST_NAME;
```
Although you create the aliases in the FROM clause, you can use them earlier in the query, as shown in the following example:
```
SELECT e.FIRST_NAME "First",
e.LAST_NAME "Last",
d.DEPARTMENT_NAME "Dept. Name"
FROM EMPLOYEES e, DEPARTMENTS d
WHERE e.DEPARTMENT_ID = d.DEPARTMENT_ID
ORDER BY d.DEPARTMENT_NAME, e.LAST_NAME;
```
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about joins
**Example 2-12 Selecting Data from Two Tables (Joining Two Tables)**
```
SELECT EMPLOYEES.FIRST_NAME "First",
EMPLOYEES.LAST_NAME "Last",
DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME "Dept. Name"
FROM EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS
WHERE EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID = DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID
ORDER BY DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME, EMPLOYEES.LAST_NAME;
```
Result:
```

## Using Operators and Functions in Queries
The select_list of a query can include SQL expressions, which can include SQL operators and SQL functions. These operators and functions can have table data as operands and arguments. The SQL expressions are evaluated, and their values appear in the results of the query.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for more information about SQL operators
**
- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for more information about SQL functions
### Using Arithmetic Operators in Queries
The basic arithmetic operators—+ (addition), - (subtraction), \* (multiplication), and / (division)—operate on column values.
The query in Example 2-13 displays LAST_NAME, SALARY (monthly pay), and annual pay for each employee in department 90, in descending order of SALARY.
**Example 2-13 Using an Arithmetic Expression in a Query**
```
SELECT LAST_NAME,
SALARY "Monthly Pay",
SALARY * 12 "Annual Pay"
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 90
ORDER BY SALARY DESC;
```
Result:
```
LAST_NAME                 Monthly Pay Annual Pay
------------------------- ----------- ----------
King                            24000     288000
De Haan                         17000     204000
Kochhar                         17000     204000
```
### Using Numeric Functions in Queries
Numeric functions accept numeric input and return numeric values. Each numeric function returns a single value for each row that is evaluated.
The numeric functions that SQL supports are listed and described in *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The query in Example 2-14 uses the numeric function `ROUND` to display the daily pay of each employee in department 100, rounded to the nearest cent.
The query in Example 2-15 uses the numeric function `TRUNC` to display the daily pay of each employee in department 100, truncated to the nearest dollar.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about SQL numeric functions
**Example 2-14 Rounding Numeric Data**
```
SELECT LAST_NAME,
ROUND (((SALARY * 12)/365), 2) "Daily Pay"
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 100
ORDER BY LAST_NAME;
```
Result:
```

### Using the Concatenation Operator in Queries
The concatenation operator (`||`) combines two strings into one string, by appending the second string to the first. For example, `'a'||'b'='ab'`. You can use this operator to combine information from two columns or expressions in the same column of a query result.
The query in Example 2-16 concatenates the first name, a space, and the last name of each selected employee.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about the concatenation operator
**Example 2-16 Concatenating Character Data**
```
SELECT FIRST_NAME || ' ' || LAST_NAME "Name"
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 100
ORDER BY LAST_NAME;
```
Result:
```

### Using Character Functions in Queries
Character functions accept character input. Most return character values, but some return numeric values. Each character function returns a single value for each row that is evaluated.
The character functions that SQL supports are listed and described in *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The functions UPPER, INITCAP, and LOWER display their character arguments in uppercase, initial capital, and lowercase, respectively.
The query in Example 2-17 displays LAST_NAME in uppercase, FIRST_NAME with the first character in uppercase and all others in lowercase, and EMAIL in lowercase.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about SQL character functions
**Example 2-17 Changing the Case of Character Data**
```
SELECT UPPER(LAST_NAME) "Last",
INITCAP(FIRST_NAME) "First",
LOWER(EMAIL) "E-Mail"
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 100
ORDER BY EMAIL;
```
Result:
```
Last                      First                E-Mail

### Using Datetime Functions in Queries
Datetime functions operate on DATE, time stamp, and interval values. Each datetime function returns a single value for each row that is evaluated.
The datetime functions that SQL supports are listed and described in *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
For each DATE and time stamp value, Oracle Database stores thed following information:
- Year
- Month
- Date
- Hour
- Minute
- Second
For each time stamp value, Oracle Database also stores the fractional part of the second, whose precision you can specify. To store the time zone also, use the data type TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE or TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE.
For more information about the DATE data type, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
For more information about the TIMESTAMP data type, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
For information about the other time stamp data types and the interval data types, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The query in Example 2-18 uses the EXTRACT and SYSDATE functions to show how many years each employee in department 100 has been employed. The SYSDATE function returns the current date of the system clock as a DATE value. For more information about the SYSDATE function, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*. For information about the EXTRACT function, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The query in Example 2-19 uses the SYSTIMESTAMP function to display the current system date and time. The SYSTIMESTAMP function returns a TIMESTAMP value. For information about the SYSTIMESTAMP function, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The table in the FROM clause of the query, DUAL, is a one-row table that Oracle Database creates automatically along with the data dictionary. Select from DUAL when you want to compute a constant expression with the SELECT statement. Because DUAL has only one row, the constant is returned only once. For more information about selecting from DUAL, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about SQL datetime functions
**Example 2-18 Displaying the Number of Years Between Dates**
```
SELECT LAST_NAME,
(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM HIRE_DATE)) "Years Employed"
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 100
ORDER BY "Years Employed";
```
Result:
```
LAST_NAME                 Years Employed
------------------------- --------------

**Example 2-19 Displaying System Date and Time**
```
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) || ':' ||
EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) || ':' ||
ROUND(EXTRACT(SECOND FROM SYSTIMESTAMP), 0) || ', ' ||
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) || '/' ||
EXTRACT(DAY FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) || '/' ||
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) "System Time and Date"
FROM DUAL;
```
Results depend on current SYSTIMESTAMP value, but have the following format:
```
System Time and Date
-------------------------------------------------------------------
18:17:53, 12/27/2012
```
### Using Conversion Functions in Queries
Conversion functions convert one data type to another.
The conversion functions that SQL supports are listed and described in *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The query in Example 2-20 uses the TO_CHAR function to convert HIRE_DATE values (which are of type DATE) to character values that have the format `FMMonth DD YYYY` . `FM` removes leading and trailing blanks from the month name. `FMMonth DD YYYY` is an example of a **datetime format model**. For information about datetime format models, see *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The query in Example 2-21 uses the TO_NUMBER function to convert POSTAL_CODE values (which are of type VARCHAR2) to values of type NUMBER, which it uses in calculations.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for more information about SQL conversion functions
- “About the NLS_DATE_FORMAT Parameter”
**Example 2-20 Converting Dates to Characters Using a Format Template**
```
SELECT LAST_NAME,
HIRE_DATE,
TO_CHAR(HIRE_DATE, 'FMMonth DD YYYY') "Date Started"
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 100
ORDER BY LAST_NAME;
```
Result:
```
LAST_NAME                 HIRE_DATE Date Started

### Using Aggregate Functions in Queries
An aggregate function takes a group of rows and returns a single result row. The group of rows can be an entire table or view.
The aggregate functions that SQL supports are listed and described in *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
Aggregate functions are especially powerful when used with the GROUP BY clause, which groups query results by one or more columns, with a result for each group.
The query in Example 2-22 uses the COUNT function and the GROUP BY clause to show how many people report to each manager. The wildcard character, *, represents an entire record.
Example 2-22 shows that one employee does not report to a manager. The following query selects the first name, last name, and job title of that employee:
```
COLUMN FIRST_NAME FORMAT A10;
COLUMN LAST_NAME FORMAT A10;
COLUMN JOB_TITLE FORMAT A10;
SELECT e.FIRST_NAME,
e.LAST_NAME,
j.JOB_TITLE
FROM EMPLOYEES e, JOBS j
WHERE e.JOB_ID = j.JOB_ID
AND MANAGER_ID IS NULL;
```
Result:
```
FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME  JOB_TITLE
---------- ---------- ----------
Steven     King       President
```
To have the query return only rows where aggregate values meet specified conditions, use an aggregate function in the HAVING clause of the query.
The query in Example 2-23 shows how much each department spends annually on salaries, but only for departments for which that amount exceeds $1,000,000.
The query in Example 2-24 uses several aggregate functions to show statistics for the salaries of each JOB_ID.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for more information about SQL aggregate functions
**Example 2-22 Counting the Number of Rows in Each Group**
```
SELECT MANAGER_ID "Manager",
COUNT(*) "Number of Reports"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY MANAGER_ID
ORDER BY MANAGER_ID;
```
Result:
```
Manager Number of Reports

### Using NULL-Related Functions in Queries
The NULL-related functions facilitate the handling of NULL values.
The NULL-related functions that SQL supports are listed and described in *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference*.
The query in Example 2-25 returns the last name and commission of the employees whose last names begin with ‘B’. If an employee receives no commission (that is, if COMMISSION_PCT is NULL), the NVL function substitutes “Not Applicable” for NULL.
The query in Example 2-26 returns the last name, salary, and income of the employees whose last names begin with ‘B’, using the NVL2 function: If COMMISSION_PCT is not NULL, the income is the salary plus the commission; if COMMISSION_PCT is NULL, income is only the salary.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for more information about the NVL function
**

### Using CASE Expressions in Queries
A CASE expression lets you use IF … THEN … ELSE logic in SQL statements without invoking subprograms. There are two kinds of CASE expressions, simple and searched.
The query in Example 2-27 uses a simple CASE expression to show the country name for each country code.
The query in Example 2-28 uses a searched CASE expression to show proposed salary increases (15%, 10%, 5%, or 0%), based on date ranges associated with length of service.
**See Also:**

### Using the DECODE Function in Queries
The DECODE function compares an expression to several search values. Whenever the value of the expression matches a search value, DECODE returns the result associated with that search value. If DECODE finds no match, then it returns the default value (if specified) or NULL (if no default value is specified).
The query in Example 2-29 uses the DECODE function to show proposed salary increases for three different jobs. The expression is JOB_ID; the search values are ‘PU_CLERK’, ‘SH_CLERK’, and ‘ST_CLERK’; and the default is SALARY.
**Note:**   The arguments of the DECODE function can be any of the SQL numeric or character types. Oracle automatically converts the expression and each search value to the data type of the first search value before comparing. Oracle automatically converts the return value to the same data type as the first result. If the first result has the data type CHAR or if the first result is NULL, then Oracle converts the return value to the data type VARCHAR2.

**Example 2-29 Using the DECODE Function in a Query**
```
SELECT LAST_NAME, JOB_ID, SALARY,
DECODE(JOB_ID,
'PU_CLERK', SALARY * 1.10,
'SH_CLERK', SALARY * 1.15,
'ST_CLERK', SALARY * 1.20,
SALARY) "Proposed Salary"
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE JOB_ID LIKE '%_CLERK'
AND LAST_NAME < 'E'
ORDER BY LAST_NAME;
```
Result:
```
LAST_NAME                 JOB_ID         SALARY Proposed Salary
