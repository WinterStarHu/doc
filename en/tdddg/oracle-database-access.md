# About Oracle Database Access

You can access Oracle Database only through a client program such as SQL*Plus or SQL Developer.
The client program’s interface to Oracle Database is Structured Query Language (SQL). Oracle provides an extension to SQL called Procedural Language/SQL (PL/SQL).
## About SQL*Plus
**SQL*Plus** (pronounced *sequel plus*) is an interactive and batch query tool that is installed with every Oracle Database installation. It has a command-line user interface that acts as the client when connecting to the database.
SQL*Plus has its own commands and environment. In the SQL*Plus environment, you can enter and run SQL*Plus commands, SQL statements, PL/SQL statements, and operating system commands to perform the following tasks:
- Formatting, performing calculations on, storing, and printing query results
- Examining tables and object definitions
- Developing and running batch scripts
- Performing database administration
You can use SQL*Plus to generate reports interactively, to generate reports as batch processes, and to output the results to text file, to screen, or to HTML file for browsing on the Internet. You can generate reports dynamically using the HTML output facility.
You can use SQL*Plus in SQL Developer. For details, see *Oracle SQL Developer User’s Guide*.

## About SQL Developer
**SQL Developer** (pronounced *sequel developer*) is a graphical user interface for Oracle Database, that is available in the default installation of Oracle Database and by free download from the Oracle Technology Network.
SQL Developer serves as a modern integrated development environment (IDE) for SQL and PL/SQL, and provides a graphical interface for managing database objects. You can also create reports, design data models, migrate third-party databases to Oracle, REST-enable tables and views, and deploy and manage Oracle REST Data Services. The SQL Worksheet allows you to enter and run SQL statements, PL/SQL statements, and SQL*Plus commands and scripts.
**Note:**   SQL Developer often offers several ways to do a task, but this document does not explain every possible way.

## About Structured Query Language (SQL)
**Structured Query Language (SQL)** (pronounced *sequel*) is the set-based, high-level computer language with which all programs and users access data in Oracle Database.
SQL is a declarative, or nonprocedural, language; that is, it describes what to do, but not how. You specify the desired result set (for example, the names of current employees), but not how to get it.

## About Procedural Language/SQL (PL/SQL)
**Procedural Language/SQL (PL/SQL)** (pronounced *P L sequel*) is a native Oracle Database extension to SQL. It bridges the gap between declarative and imperative program control by adding procedural elements, such as conditional control and loops.
In PL/SQL, you can declare constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variables of those types, and triggers. You can handle exceptions (runtime errors). You can create PL/SQL units-procedures, functions, packages, types, and triggers-that are stored in the database for reuse by applications that use any of the Oracle Database programmatic interfaces.
The basic unit of a PL/SQL source program is the block, which groups related declarations and statements. A block has an optional declarative part, a required executable part, and an optional exception-handling part.
