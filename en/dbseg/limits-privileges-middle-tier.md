# Limits to the Privileges of the Middle Tier

Least privilege is the principle that users should have the fewest privileges necessary to perform their duties and no more.
As applied to middle tier applications, this means that the middle tier should not have more privileges than it needs.
Oracle Database enables you to limit the middle tier such that it can connect only on behalf of certain database users, using only specific database roles. You can limit the privilege of the middle tier to connect on behalf of an enterprise user, stored in an LDAP directory, by granting to the middle tier the privilege to connect as the mapped database user. For instance, if the enterprise user is mapped to the `APPUSER` schema, then you must at least grant to the middle tier the ability to connect on behalf of `APPUSER`. Otherwise, attempts to create a session for the enterprise user will fail.
However, you cannot limit the ability of the middle tier to connect on behalf of enterprise users. For example, suppose that user Sarah wants to connect to the database through a middle tier, `appsrv` (which is also a database user). Sarah has multiple roles, but it is desirable to restrict the middle tier to use only the `clerk` role on her behalf.
An administrator can grant permission for `appsrv` to initiate connections on behalf of Sarah using her `clerk` role only by using the following SQL statement:
```
ALTER USER sarah GRANT CONNECT THROUGH appsrv WITH ROLE clerk;
```
By default, the middle tier cannot create connections for any client. The permission must be granted for each user.
To enable `appsrv` to use all of the roles granted to the client Sarah, you can use the following statement:
```
ALTER USER sarah GRANT CONNECT THROUGH appsrv;
```
Each time a middle tier initiates an OCI, JDBC/OCI, or Thin driver session for another database user, the database verifies that the middle tier is authorized to connect for that user by using the role specified.
**Note:**
Instead of using default roles, create your own roles and assign only necessary privileges to them. Creating your own roles enables you to control the privileges granted by them and protects you if Oracle Database changes or removes default roles. For example, the `CONNECT` role now has only the `CREATE SESSION` privilege, the one most directly needed when connecting to a database. However, `CONNECT` formerly provided several additional privileges, often not needed or appropriate for most users. Extra privileges can endanger the security of your database and applications. These have now been removed from `CONNECT`.
A proxy user in a proxy session can enable a password-protected role or secure application role only if the role has been allowed to be enabled with the `WITH ROLE` or `WITH ROLE ALL` clause. (If this clause is not specified, then `WITH ROLE ALL` is the default.) If `WITH ROLE` does not specify the secure roles, then those roles cannot be enabled, even with the correct password.
