## About Auditing Oracle Recovery Manager Events
The `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` data dictionary view automatically stores Oracle Recovery Manager audit events in the `RMAN_`column.
Unlike other Oracle Database components, you do not create a unified audit policy for Oracle Recovery Manager events.
However, you must have the `AUDIT_ADMIN` or `AUDIT_VIEWER` role in order to query the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` view to see these events. If you have the `SYSBACKUP` or the `SYSDBA` administrative privilege, then you can find additional information about Recovery Manager jobs by querying views such as `V$RMAN_STATUS` or `V$RMAN_BACKUP_JOB_DETAILS`.
