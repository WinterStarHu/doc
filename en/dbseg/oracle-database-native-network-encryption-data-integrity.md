# Oracle Database Native Network Encryption Data Integrity

Encrypting network data provides data privacy so that unauthorized parties cannot view plaintext data as it passes over the network.
Oracle Database also provides protection against two forms of active attacks.
The following table provides information about these attacks.
| Type of Attack | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Data modification attack | An unauthorized party intercepting data in transit, altering it, and retransmitting it is a data modification attack. For example, intercepting a $100 bank deposit, changing the amount to $10,000, and retransmitting the higher amount is a data modification attack. |
| Replay attack | Repetitively retransmitting an entire set of valid data is a replay attack, such as intercepting a $100 bank withdrawal and retransmitting it ten times, thereby receiving $1,000. |
