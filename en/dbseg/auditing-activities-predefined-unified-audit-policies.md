- Oracle Database Vault Predefined Unified Audit Policy for DVSYS and LBACSYS Schemas The ORA_DV_AUDPOL predefined unified audit policy audits Oracle Database Vault DVSYS and LBACSYS schema objects.
- Oracle Database Vault Predefined Unified Audit Policy for Default Realms and Command Rules The ORA_DV_AUDPOL2 predefined unified audit policy audits the Oracle Database Vault default realms and command rules.
## Logon Failures Predefined Unified Audit Policy
The `ORA_LOGON_FAILURES` unified audit policy tracks failed logons only, but not any other kinds of logons.
For new databases, this policy is enabled by default for both pure unified auditing and mixed-mode auditing environments. This policy is not enabled for databases that were upgraded from earlier versions, except if you have created a new database from the previous release and then upgrade it to the current release.
**Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
The following `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement shows the `ORA_LOGON_FAILURES` unified audit policy definition:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY ORA_LOGON_FAILURES ACTIONS LOGON;
```
You should enable the `ORA_LOGON_FAILURES` unified audit policy as follows:
```
AUDIT POLICY ORA_LOGON_FAILURES WHENEVER NOT SUCCESSFUL;
```
## Secure Options Predefined Unified Audit Policy
The `ORA_SECURECONFIG` unified audit policy provides all the secure configuration audit options.
For new databases, this policy is enabled by default for both pure unified auditing and mixed-mode auditing environments. This policy is not enabled for databases that were upgraded from earlier versions, except if you have created a new database from the previous release and then upgrade it to the current release.
**Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
The following statement shows the `ORA_SECURECONFIG` unified audit policy definition.
```
PRIVILEGES ALTER ANY TABLE, CREATE ANY TABLE, DROP ANY TABLE,
            CREATE ANY PROCEDURE, DROP ANY PROCEDURE, ALTER ANY PROCEDURE,
            GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE,
            AUDIT SYSTEM, CREATE EXTERNAL JOB, CREATE ANY JOB,
            CREATE ANY LIBRARY,
            EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY,
            CREATE USER, DROP USER,
            ALTER DATABASE, ALTER SYSTEM,
            CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM, DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM,
            CREATE SQL TRANSLATION PROFILE, CREATE ANY SQL TRANSLATION
PROFILE,
            DROP ANY SQL TRANSLATION PROFILE, ALTER ANY SQL TRANSLATION

            TRANSLATE ANY SQL,
            EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY,
            PURGE DBA_RECYCLEBIN, LOGMINING,
            ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT, BECOME USER

            DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE,
            ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE,
            EXECUTE ON DBMS_RLS,
            ALTER DATABASE DICTIONARY;
```
**Note:**  An audit policy created on any standard action(s): `CREATE USER`, `ALTER USER`, `DROP USER`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `CREATE ROLE`, `ALTER ROLE`, `DROP ROLE`, and `CHANGE PASSWORD` will also audit the respective RAS action(s). Oracle has added the equivalent RAS component action(s), such as `GRANT PRIVILEGE` and `GRANT ROLE`, to the audit policy definition if the policy contained any of the previously stated standard actions, such as `GRANT`. The XS component actions added to the audit policy definition are visible in `AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES`.
To enable `ORA_SECURECONFIG`, run the following command:
```
AUDIT POLICY ORA_SECURECONFIG;
```
## Oracle Database Parameter Changes Predefined Unified Audit Policy
The `ORA_DATABASE_PARAMETER` policy audits commonly used Oracle Database parameter modification commands.
**Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
The following statement shows the `ORA_DATABASE_PARAMETER` unified audit policy definition. By default, this policy is not enabled.
```
ACTIONS ALTER DATABASE, ALTER SYSTEM, CREATE SPFILE;
```
To enable `ORA_DATABASE_PARAMETER`, run the following command:
```
AUDIT POLICY ORA_DATABASE_PARAMETER;

## User Account and Privilege Management Predefined Unified Audit Policy
The `ORA_ACCOUNT_MGMT` policy audits commonly used user account and privilege settings.
**Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.

```
ACTIONS CREATE USER, ALTER USER, DROP USER, CREATE ROLE, DROP ROLE,
  ALTER ROLE, SET ROLE, GRANT, REVOKE;
```
**Note:**  An audit policy created on any standard action(s): `CREATE USER`, `ALTER USER`, `DROP USER`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `CREATE ROLE`, `ALTER ROLE`, `DROP ROLE`, and `CHANGE PASSWORD` will also audit the respective RAS action(s). Oracle has added the equivalent RAS component action(s), such as `GRANT PRIVILEGE` and `GRANT ROLE`, to the audit policy definition if the policy contained any of the previously stated standard actions, such as `GRANT`. The XS component actions added to the audit policy definition are visible in `AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES`.

**Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
The following statement shows the `ORA_CIS_RECOMMENDATIONS` unified audit policy definition. By default, this policy is not enabled.

### System Administrator Operations Predefined Unified Audit Policy
The `ORA_RAS_POLICY_MGMT` predefined unified audit policy audits policies for all Oracle Real Application Security administrative actions on application users, roles, and policies.
 **Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
The following statement describes the `ORA_RAS_POLICY_MGMT` audit policy. By default, this policy is not enabled.
```
ACTIONS COMPONENT=XS
  CREATE USER, UPDATE USER, DELETE USER,
  CREATE ROLE, UPDATE ROLE, DELETE ROLE, GRANT ROLE, REVOKE ROLE,
  ADD PROXY, REMOVE PROXY,
  SET USER PASSWORD, SET USER VERIFIER, SET USER PROFILE,

  CREATE NAMESPACE TEMPLATE, UPDATE NAMESPACE TEMPLATE, DELETE NAMESPACE TEMPLATE,
  CREATE ACL, UPDATE ACL, DELETE ACL,
  CREATE DATA SECURITY, UPDATE DATA SECURITY, DELETE DATA SECURITY,
  ENABLE DATA SECURITY, DISABLE DATA SECURITY,
  ADD GLOBAL CALLBACK, DELETE GLOBAL CALLBACK, ENABLE GLOBAL CALLBACK;
```
For STIG compliance, enable the `ORA_RAS_POLICY_MGMT` unified audit policy for all users.
```
AUDIT POLICY ORA_RAS_POLICY_MGMT;
```
### Session Operations Predefined Unified Audit Policy
The `ORA_RAS_SESSION_MGMT` predefined unified audit policy audits policies for all run-time Oracle Real Application Security session actions and namespace actions.
**Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
The following statement describes the `ORA_RAS_SESSION_MGMT` policy. By default, this policy is not enabled.
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY ORA_RAS_SESSION_MGMT
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=XS
  CREATE SESSION, DESTROY SESSION,

```
## Oracle Database Vault Predefined Unified Audit Policy for DVSYS and LBACSYS Schemas
The `ORA_DV_AUDPOL` predefined unified audit policy audits Oracle Database Vault `DVSYS` and `LBACSYS` schema objects.
The `ORA_DV_AUDPOL` policy audits all actions that are performed on the Oracle Database Vault `DVSYS` (including `DVF`) schema objects and the Oracle Label Security `LBACSYS` schema objects. It does not capture actions on the `F$`* factor functions in the `DVF` schema. By default, this policy is not enabled.
**Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
To view the complete definition of this policy, query the `AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES` data dictionary view, where `POLICY_NAME` is `ORA_DV_AUDPOL`. Because this policy audits actions on schema objects, query the `AUDIT_OPTION`, `OBJECT_SCHEMA`, and `OBJECT_NAME` columns to see the audited actions and the schema objects on which they are audited.
```
SELECT AUDIT_OPTION || ' on ' || OBJECT_SCHEMA || '.' || OBJECT_NAME
       AS audit_option_on_objects
FROM AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES
WHERE POLICY_NAME = 'ORA_DV_AUDPOL'
ORDER BY 1;
```

## Oracle Database Vault Predefined Unified Audit Policy for Default Realms and Command Rules
The `ORA_DV_AUDPOL2` predefined unified audit policy audits the Oracle Database Vault default realms and command rules.
The `ORA_DV_AUDPOL2` policy constitutes the audit settings of the Oracle Database Vault-supplied default realms and command rules. By default, this policy is not enabled.
 **Note:**   Only user `SYS` can alter or drop this predefined policy.
To view the complete definition of this policy, query the `AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES` data dictionary view, where `POLICY_NAME` is `ORA_DV_AUDPOL2`. Query the `AUDIT_OPTION`, `OBJECT_SCHEMA`, and `OBJECT_NAME` columns to see more details about the audit options and object-specific entries for this policy.
