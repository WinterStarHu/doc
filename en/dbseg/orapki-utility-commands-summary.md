````````
- sign_alg specifies the certificate signature algorithm. For an ML-DSA operation, specify mldsa44, mldsa65, or mldsa87 to match the selected ML-DSA variant.
``````
- cert_validation_mode specifies if strict certificate validation, conforming to the RFC#5280 standard is (strict) or is not (non-strict) being used.
## orapki cert display
The `orapki cert display` command displays details of a specific certificate.
**Syntax**
```
orapki cert display -cert certificate_location [-summary|-complete]
```
- cert specifies the location of the certificate you want to display.
````
  - summary displays the certificate and its expiration date
  - complete displays additional certificate information, including the serial number and public key
## orapki crl delete Command
The `orapki crl delete `command deletes a certificate revocation list (CRL) from Oracle Internet Directory.
The user who deletes the CRLs from the directory by using `orapki` must be a member of the `CRLAdmins` (`cn=CRLAdmins,cn=groups,%s_OracleContextDN%`) directory group.
**Prerequisites**
None
**Syntax**
```
orapki crl delete -issuer issuer_name -ldap hostname:ssl_port -user username [-wallet wallet_location] [-summary]
```
- issuer specifies the name of the certificate authority (CA) who issued the CRL.
- ldap specifies the host name and SSL port for the directory where the CRLs are to be deleted. Note that this must be a directory SSL port with no authentication. See also Uploading CRLs to Oracle Internet Directory for more information about this port.
- user specifies the user name of the directory user who has permission to delete CRLs from the CRL subtree in the directory.
- wallet (optional) specifies the location of the wallet that contains the certificate of the certificate authority (CA) who issued the CRL. Using it causes the tool to verify the validity of the CRL against the CA’s certificate prior to deleting it from the directory.
- summary is optional. It displays the CRL LDAP entry that was deleted.
## orapki crl display
The `orapki crl display` command displays a specified certificate revocation list (CRL) that is stored in Oracle Internet Directory.
**Syntax**
```
orapki crl display -crl crl_location [-wallet wallet_location] [-summary|-complete]
```
````
- crl parameter specifies the location of the CRL in the directory. It is convenient to paste the CRL location from the list that displays when you use the orapki crl list command. See orapki crl list.
- wallet (optional) specifies the location of the wallet that contains the certificate of the certificate authority (CA) who issued the CRL. Using it causes the tool to verify the validity of the CRL against the CA’s certificate prior to displaying it.
````
  - summary provides a listing that contains the CRL issuer’s name and the CRL’s validity period
  - complete provides a list of all revoked certificates that the CRL contains. Note that this option may take a long time to display, depending on the size of the CRL.
## orapki crl hash
The `orapki crl hash` command generates a hash value of the certificate revocation list (CRL) issuer to identify the CRL file system location for certificate validation.
**Syntax**
```
orapki crl hash -crl crl_filename\|URL [-wallet wallet_location] [-symlink|-copy] crl_directory [-summary]
```
- crl specifies the filename that contains the CRL or the URL where it can be found.
- wallet (optional) specifies the location of the wallet that contains the certificate of the certificate authority (CA) who issued the CRL. Using it causes the tool to verify the validity of the CRL against the CA’s certificate prior to uploading it to the directory.
````
````
  - (UNIX) symlink creates a symbolic link to the CRL at the crl_directory location
````
  - (Windows) copy creates a copy of the CRL at the crl_directory location
- summary (optional) displays the CRL issuer’s name.
## orapki crl list
The `orapki crl list` command displays a list of certificate revocation lists (CRLs) stored in Oracle Internet Directory.
**Syntax**
This is useful for browsing to locate a particular CRL to view or download to your local file system.
```
orapki crl list -ldap hostname:ssl_port
```
`ldap` specifies the host name and SSL port for the directory server from where you want to list CRLs. Note that this must be a directory SSL port with no authentication.
## orapki crl upload
The `orapki crl upload` command uploads a certificate revocation list (CRL) to the CRL subtree in Oracle Internet Directory.
Note that you must be a member of the directory administrative group `CRLAdmins` (`cn=CRLAdmins,cn=groups,%s_OracleContextDN%`) to upload CRLs to the directory.
**Syntax**
```
orapki crl upload -crl crl_location -ldap hostname:ssl_port -user username [-wallet wallet_location] [-summary]
```
- crl specifies the directory location or the URL where the CRL is located that you are uploading to the directory.
- ldap specifies the host name and SSL port for the directory where you are uploading the CRLs. Note that this must be a directory SSL port with no authentication. See also Uploading CRLs to Oracle Internet Directory for more information about this port.
- user specifies the user name of the directory user who has permission to add CRLs to the CRL subtree in the directory.
- wallet specifies the location of the wallet that contains the certificate of the certificate authority (CA) who issued the CRL. This is an optional parameter. Using it causes the tool to verify the validity of the CRL against the CA’s certificate prior to uploading it to the directory.
- summary is optional. It displays the CRL issuer’s name and the LDAP entry where the CRL is stored in the directory.
## orapki wallet add
The `orapki wallet add` command adds certificate requests and certificates to an Oracle wallet.

These thumbprints select a particular certificate from the wallet and are displayed when you run the `orapki wallet display` command. You can specify an alias when you store a private key. The alias and thumbprint enable you to specify the exact private key to use with the connect string.
**Syntax**
```
orapki wallet display [-wallet [wallet_file_directory]] [-summary | [-complete | -complete -details]]
[-pwd wallet_password] [-ssvs]
```
- wallet specifies a location for the wallet you want to open if it is not located in the current working directory.
