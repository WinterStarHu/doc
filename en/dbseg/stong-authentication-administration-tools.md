# Strong Authentication Administration Tools

You can use a set of strong authentication administration tools for native network encryption and public key infrastructure credentials.
- About the Configuration and Administration Tools The configuration and administration tools manage the encryption, integrity (checksumming), and strong authentication methods for Oracle Net Services.
- Native Network Encryption and Strong Authentication Configuration Tools Oracle Net Services can encrypt data using standard encryption algorithms, and for strong authentication methods, such as Kerberos, RADIUS, and SSL.
- Public Key Infrastructure Credentials Management Tools The security provided by a public key infrastructure (PKI) depends on how effectively you store, manage, and validate your PKI credentials.
- Duties of Strong Authentication Administrators Most of the tasks of a security administrator involve ensuring that the connections to and from Oracle databases are secure.
## About the Configuration and Administration Tools
The configuration and administration tools manage the encryption, integrity (checksumming), and strong authentication methods for Oracle Net Services.
Strong authentication method configuration can include third-party software, as is the case for Kerberos or RADIUS, or it may entail configuring and managing a public key infrastructure for using digital certificates with Transport Layer Security (TLS).
## Native Network Encryption and Strong Authentication Configuration Tools
Oracle Net Services can encrypt data using standard encryption algorithms, and for strong authentication methods, such as Kerberos, RADIUS, and SSL.
- About Oracle Net Manager Oracle Net Manager configures Oracle Net Services for an Oracle home on a local client or server host.
- Kerberos Adapter Command-Line Utilities The Kerberos adapter provides command-line utilities that obtain, cache, display, and remove Kerberos credentials.
### About Oracle Net Manager
Oracle Net Manager configures Oracle Net Services for an Oracle home on a local client or server host.
Although you can use Oracle Net Manager, a graphical user interface tool, to configure Oracle Net Services, such as naming, listeners, and general network settings, it also enables you to configure the following features, which use the Oracle Net protocol:
- Strong authentication (Kerberos, RADIUS, and Transport Layer Security)
- Native network encryption (RC4, DES, 3DES, and AES)
****
- Checksumming for data integrity (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2) Note: The DES, 3DES112, 3DES168, MD5, and RC4 algorithms are deprecated in this release. To transition your Oracle Database environment to use stronger algorithms, download and install the patch described in My Oracle Support note 2118136.2.
### Kerberos Adapter Command-Line Utilities
The Kerberos adapter provides command-line utilities that obtain, cache, display, and remove Kerberos credentials.
The following table briefly describes these utilities.
| Utility Name | Description |
|---|---|
| okinit | Obtains Kerberos tickets from the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and caches them in the user’s credential cache |
| oklist | Displays a list of Kerberos tickets in the specified credential cache |
| okdstry | Removes Kerberos credentials from the specified credential cache |
| okcreate | Automates the creation of keytabs from either the KDC or a service endpoint |
**Note:**   The Cybersafe adapter is not supported beginning with this release. You should use Oracle’s Kerberos adapter in its place. Kerberos authentication with the Cybersafe KDC (Trust Broker) continues to be supported when using the Kerberos adapter.
## Public Key Infrastructure Credentials Management Tools
The security provided by a public key infrastructure (PKI) depends on how effectively you store, manage, and validate your PKI credentials.
- About Oracle Wallet Manager Wallet owners and security administrators use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage and edit the security credentials in their Oracle wallets.
- About the orapki Utility The orapki utility manages certificate revocation lists (CRLs), creates and manages Oracle wallets, and creates signed certificates.
### About Oracle Wallet Manager
Wallet owners and security administrators use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage and edit the security credentials in their Oracle wallets.
A wallet is a password-protected container that is used to store authentication and signing credentials, including private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates needed by Transport Layer Security. You can use Oracle Wallet Manager to perform the following tasks:
- Create public and private key pairs
- Store and manage user credentials
- Generate certificate requests
- Store and manage certificate authority certificates (root key certificate and certificate chain)
- Upload and download wallets to and from an LDAP directory
****
- Create wallets to store hardware security module credentials Note: In previous releases of Oracle Database, you could use Oracle Wallet Manager to configure wallets for Transparent Data Encryption. In this release, you can use the ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SQL statement instead.
### About the orapki Utility
The `orapki` utility manages certificate revocation lists (CRLs), creates and manages Oracle wallets, and creates signed certificates.
The basic syntax for this command-line utility is as follows:
```
orapki module command -option_1 argument ... -option_n argument
```
For example, the following command lists all certificate revocation lists (CRLs) in the CRL subtree in an instance of Oracle Internet Directory that is installed on `machine
1.us.example.com` and that uses port 389:
```
orapki crl list -ldap machine1.us.example.com:389
```
**Note:**   The use of `orapki` to configure Transparent Data Encryption has been deprecated. Instead, use the `ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT` SQL statement.
