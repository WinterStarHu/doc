## Purpose
`VSIZE` returns the number of bytes in the internal representation of *expr*. If *expr* is null, then this function returns null.
This function does not support `CLOB` data directly. However, `CLOB`s can be passed in as arguments through implicit data conversion.
**See Also:**    “Data Type Comparison Rules” for more information
## Examples
The following example returns the number of bytes in the `last_name` column of the employees in department 10:
```
SELECT last_name, VSIZE (last_name) "BYTES"
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id = 10
  ORDER BY employee_id;
LAST_NAME            BYTES
--------------- ----------

```
