## Purpose
`FEATURE_VALUE` returns a feature value for each row in the selection. The value refers to the highest value feature or to the specified *feature_id*. The feature value is returned as `BINARY_DOUBLE`.
## Syntax Choice
`FEATURE_VALUE` can score the data in one of two ways: It can apply a mining model object to the data, or it can dynamically mine the data by executing an analytic clause that builds and applies one or more transient mining models. Choose **Syntax** or **Analytic Syntax**:
****
- Syntax — Use the first syntax to score the data with a pre-defined model. Supply the name of a feature extraction model.
****************
- Analytic Syntax — Use the analytic syntax to score the data without a pre-defined model. Include INTO n, where n is the number of features to extract, and mining_analytic_clause, which specifies if the data should be partitioned for multiple model builds. The mining_analytic_clause supports a query_partition_clause and an order_by_clause. (See “analytic_clause::=”.)
The syntax of the `FEATURE_VALUE` function can use an optional `GROUPING` hint when scoring a partitioned model. See GROUPING Hint.
## mining_attribute_clause
*mining_attribute_clause* identifies the column attributes to use as predictors for scoring. When the function is invoked with the analytic syntax, this data is also used for building the transient models. The *mining_attribute_clause* behaves as described for the `PREDICTION` function. (See “mining_attribute_clause::=”.)

## Example
The following example lists the customers that correspond to feature 3, ordered by match quality.
```
SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT cust_id, FEATURE_VALUE(nmf_sh_sample, 3 USING *) match_quality
          FROM nmf_sh_sample_apply_prepared
          ORDER BY match_quality DESC)
  WHERE ROWNUM < 11;
   CUST_ID MATCH_QUALITY
