# REMAINDER

## Syntax

## Purpose
`REMAINDER` returns the remainder of *n2* divided by *n1*.
This function takes as arguments any numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. Oracle determines the argument with the highest numeric precedence, implicitly converts the remaining arguments to that data type, and returns that data type.
The `MOD` function is similar to `REMAINDER` except that it uses `FLOOR` in its formula, whereas `REMAINDER` uses `ROUND`. Refer to MOD.
**See Also:**   Table 2-8 for more information on implicit conversion and “Numeric Precedence” for information on numeric precedence
****
  - An error if the arguments are of type NUMBER
``````
  - NaN if the arguments are BINARY_FLOAT or BINARY_DOUBLE.
**********************
- If n1 != 0, then the remainder is n2 - (n1*N) where N is the integer nearest n2/n1. If n2/n1 equals x.5, then N is the nearest even integer.
****
- If n2 is a floating-point number, and if the remainder is 0, then the sign of the remainder is the sign of n2. Remainders of 0 are unsigned for NUMBER values.
## Examples
Using table `float_point_demo`, created for the `TO_BINARY_DOUBLE` “Examples”, the following example divides two floating-point numbers and returns the remainder of that operation:
```
SELECT bin_float, bin_double, REMAINDER(bin_float, bin_double)
  FROM float_point_demo;
 BIN_FLOAT BIN_DOUBLE REMAINDER(BIN_FLOAT,BIN_DOUBLE)
