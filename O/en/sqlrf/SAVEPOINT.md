# SAVEPOINT

## Purpose

## Syntax

Description of the illustration savepoint.eps
## Semantics
## *savepoint*
Specify the name of the savepoint to be created.
Savepoint names must be distinct within a given transaction. If you create a second savepoint with the same identifier as an earlier savepoint, then the earlier savepoint is erased. After a savepoint has been created, you can either continue processing, commit your work, roll back the entire transaction, or roll back to the savepoint.
## Examples
**Creating Savepoints: Example**
To update the salary for `Banda` and `Greene` in the sample table `hr.employees`, check that the total department salary does not exceed 314,000, then reenter the salary for `Greene`:
```
UPDATE employees
    SET salary = 7000
    WHERE last_name = 'Banda';
SAVEPOINT banda_sal;
UPDATE employees
    SET salary = 12000
    WHERE last_name = 'Greene';
SAVEPOINT greene_sal;
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT banda_sal;
UPDATE employees
    SET salary = 11000
    WHERE last_name = 'Greene';
COMMIT;
```
