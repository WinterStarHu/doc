# ALTER DATABASE LINK

## Purpose
Use the `ALTER` `DATABASE` `LINK` statement to modify a fixed-user database link when the password of the connection or authentication user changes.
**Note:**
**
- You cannot use this statement to change the connection or authentication user associated with the database link. To change user, you must re-create the database link.
``````
- You cannot use this statement to change the password of a connection or authentication user. You must use the ALTER USER statement for this purpose, and then alter the database link with the ALTER DATABASE LINK statement.
- This statement is valid only for fixed-user database links, not for connected-user or current user database links. See CREATE DATABASE LINK for more information on these two types of database links.
## Prerequisites
To alter a private database link, you must have the `ALTER` `DATABASE` `LINK` system privilege. To alter a public database link, you must have the `ALTER` `PUBLIC` `DATABASE` `LINK` system privilege.
## Syntax

## Semantics
The `ALTER` `DATABASE` `LINK` statement is intended only to update fixed-user database links with the current passwords of connection and authentication users. Therefore, any clauses valid in a `CREATE` `DATABASE` `LINK` statement that do not appear in the syntax diagram above are not valid in an `ALTER` `DATABASE` `LINK` statement. The semantics of all of the clauses permitted in this statement are the same as the semantics for those clauses in `CREATE` `DATABASE` `LINK`. Refer to CREATE DATABASE LINK for this information.
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to alter an existing database link.
**Note:**   You can only use `IF EXISTS` from Release 19.28 and up.
## Examples
The following statements show the valid variations of the `ALTER` `DATABASE` `LINK` statement:
```
ALTER DATABASE LINK private_link
  CONNECT TO hr IDENTIFIED BY hr_new_password;
ALTER PUBLIC DATABASE LINK public_link
  CONNECT TO scott IDENTIFIED BY scott_new_password;
ALTER SHARED PUBLIC DATABASE LINK shared_pub_link
  CONNECT TO scott IDENTIFIED BY scott_new_password
  AUTHENTICATED BY hr IDENTIFIED BY hr_new_password;
ALTER SHARED DATABASE LINK shared_pub_link
  CONNECT TO scott IDENTIFIED BY scott_new_password;
```
