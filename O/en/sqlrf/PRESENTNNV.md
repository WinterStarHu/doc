# PRESENTNNV

## Syntax
Description of the illustration presentnnv.gif
Description of the illustration presentnnv.eps
## Purpose
The `PRESENTNNV` function can be used only in the *model_clause* of the `SELECT` statement and then only on the right-hand side of a model rule. It returns *expr1* when *cell_reference* exists prior to the execution of the *model_clause* and is not null when `PRESENTNNV` is evaluated. Otherwise it returns *expr2*. This function differs from `NVL2` in that `NVL2` evaluates the data at the time it is executed, rather than evaluating the data as it was prior to the execution of the *model_clause*.
**See Also:**
**
- model_clause and “Model Expressions” for the syntax and semantics
- NVL2 for comparison

- in Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide for the collation derivation rules, which define the collation assigned to the return value of PRESENTNNV when it is a character value
## Examples
In the following example, if a row containing sales for the Mouse Pad for the year 2002 exists, and the sales value is not null, then the sales value remains unchanged. If the row exists and the sales value is null, then the sales value is set to 10. If the row does not exist, then the row is created with the sales value set to 10.
