## Purpose
`DECOMPOSE` takes as its first argument a character value *string* and returns the result of applying one of the Unicode decompositions to it. The decomposition to apply is determined by the second, optional parameter. If the character set of the first argument is not one of the Unicode character sets, `DECOMPOSE` returns the argument unmodified.
If the second argument to `DECOMPOSE` is the string `CANONICAL` (case-insensitively), `DECOMPOSE` applies canonical decomposition, as described in the Unicode Standard definition D68, and returns a string in the NFD normalization form. If the second argument is the string `COMPATIBILITY`, `DECOMPOSE` applies compatibility decomposition, as described in the Unicode Standard definition D65, and returns a string in the NFKD normalization form. The default behavior is to apply the canonical decomposition.
In a pessimistic case, the return value of `DECOMPOSE` may be a few times longer than *string*. If a string to be returned is longer than the maximum length `VARCHAR2` value in a given runtime environment, the value is silently truncated to the maximum `VARCHAR2` length.
Both arguments to `DECOMPOSE` can be of any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, or `NVARCHAR2`. Other data types are allowed if they can be implicitly converted to `VARCHAR2`or `NVARCHAR2`. The return value of `DECOMPOSE` is in the same character set as its first argument.
`CLOB` and `NCLOB` values are supported through implicit conversion. If *string* is a character LOB value, then it is converted to a `VARCHAR2` value before the `DECOMPOSE` operation. The operation will fail if the size of the LOB value exceeds the supported length of the `VARCHAR2` in the particular execution environment.

## Examples
The following example decomposes the string “`Châteaux`” into its component code points:
```
SELECT DECOMPOSE ('Châteaux')
  FROM DUAL;
DECOMPOSE
---------
Châteaux
```
**Note:**   The results of this example can vary depending on the character set of your operating system.
