## Purpose
`DECODE` compares *expr* to each *search* value one by one. If *expr* is equal to a *search*, then Oracle Database returns the corresponding *result*. If no match is found, then Oracle returns *default*. If *default* is omitted, then Oracle returns null.
The arguments can be any of the numeric types (`NUMBER`, `BINARY_FLOAT`, or `BINARY_DOUBLE`) or character types.
**********``````````**
- If expr and search are character data, then Oracle compares them using nonpadded comparison semantics. expr, search, and result can be any of the data types CHAR, VARCHAR2, NCHAR, or NVARCHAR2. The string returned is of VARCHAR2 data type and is in the same character set as the first result parameter.
******
- If the first search-result pair are numeric, then Oracle compares all search-result expressions and the first expr to determine the argument with the highest numeric precedence, implicitly converts the remaining arguments to that data type, and returns that data type.
The *search*, *result*, and *default* values can be derived from expressions. Oracle Database uses **short-circuit evaluation**. The database evaluates each *search* value only before comparing it to *expr*, rather than evaluating all *search* values before comparing any of them with *expr*. Consequently, Oracle never evaluates a *search* if a previous *search* is equal to *expr*.
Oracle automatically converts *expr* and each *search* value to the data type of the first *search* value before comparing. Oracle automatically converts the return value to the same data type as the first *result*. If the first *result* has the data type `CHAR` or if the first *result* is null, then Oracle converts the return value to the data type `VARCHAR2`.
In a `DECODE` function, Oracle considers two nulls to be equivalent. If *expr* is null, then Oracle returns the *result* of the first *search* that is also null.
The maximum number of components in the `DECODE` function, including *expr*, *searches*, *results*, and *default*, is 255.

## Examples
This example decodes the value `warehouse_id`. If `warehouse_id` is 1, then the function returns ‘`Southlake`’; if `warehouse_id` is 2, then it returns ‘`San Francisco`’; and so forth. If `warehouse_id` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, then the function returns ‘`Non domestic`’.
```
SELECT product_id,
       DECODE (warehouse_id, 1, 'Southlake',
                             2, 'San Francisco',
                             3, 'New Jersey',
                             4, 'Seattle',
                                'Non domestic') "Location"
  FROM inventories
  WHERE product_id < 1775
  ORDER BY product_id, "Location";
```
