## Purpose
`LTRIM` removes from the left end of *char* all of the characters contained in *set*. If you do not specify *set*, then it defaults to a single blank. Oracle Database begins scanning *char* from its first character and removes all characters that appear in *set* until reaching a character not in *set* and then returns the result.
Both *char* and *set* can be any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, or `NCLOB`. The string returned is of `VARCHAR2` data type if *char* is a character data type, `NVARCHAR2` if *char* is a national character data type, and a LOB if *char* is a LOB data type.

## Examples
The following example trims all the left-most occurrences of less than sign (`<`), greater than sign (`>`) , and equal sign (`=`) from a string:
```
SELECT LTRIM('<=====>BROWNING<=====>', '<>=') "LTRIM Example"
  FROM DUAL;
