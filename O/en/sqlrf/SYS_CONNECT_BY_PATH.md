## Purpose
`SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH` is valid only in hierarchical queries. It returns the path of a column value from root to node, with column values separated by *char* for each row returned by `CONNECT` `BY` condition.
Both *column* and *char* can be any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, or `NVARCHAR2`. The string returned is of `VARCHAR2` data type and is in the same character set as *column*.
