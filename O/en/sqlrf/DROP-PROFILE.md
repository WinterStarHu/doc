# DROP PROFILE

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `PROFILE` statement to remove a profile from the database. You can drop any profile except the `DEFAULT` profile.
**See Also:**   CREATE PROFILE and ALTER PROFILE on creating and modifying a profile
## Prerequisites
You must have the `DROP` `PROFILE` system privilege.
## Syntax
## *drop_profile*::=
Description of the illustration drop_profile.eps
## Semantics
## *profile*
Specify the name of the profile to be dropped.
## CASCADE
Specify `CASCADE` to deassign the profile from any users to whom it is assigned. Oracle Database automatically assigns the `DEFAULT` profile to such users. You must specify this clause to drop a profile that is currently assigned to users.
## Examples
**Dropping a Profile: Example**
The following statement drops the profile `app_user`, which was created in “Creating a Profile: Example”. Oracle Database drops the profile `app_user` and assigns the `DEFAULT` profile to any users currently assigned the `app_user` profile:
```
DROP PROFILE app_user CASCADE;
```
