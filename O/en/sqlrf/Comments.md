# Comments

You can create two types of comments:
- Comments within SQL statements are stored as part of the application code that executes the SQL statements.
- Comments associated with individual schema or nonschema objects are stored in the data dictionary along with metadata on the objects themselves.
## Comments Within SQL Statements
Comments can make your application easier for you to read and maintain. For example, you can include a comment in a statement that describes the purpose of the statement within your application. With the exception of hints, comments within SQL statements do not affect the statement execution. Refer to Hints on using this particular form of comment.
A comment can appear between any keywords, parameters, or punctuation marks in a statement. You can include a comment in a statement in two ways:
**
- Begin the comment with a slash and an asterisk (/). Proceed with the text of the comment. This text can span multiple lines. End the comment with an asterisk and a slash (/). The opening and terminating characters need not be separated from the text by a space or a line break.
- Begin the comment with – (two hyphens). Proceed with the text of the comment. This text cannot extend to a new line. End the comment with a line break.
Some of the tools used to enter SQL have additional restrictions. For example, if you are using SQL*Plus, by default you cannot have a blank line inside a multiline comment. For more information, refer to the documentation for the tool you use as an interface to the database.
A SQL statement can contain multiple comments of both styles. The text of a comment can contain any printable characters in your database character set.
**Example**
These statements contain many comments:
```
SELECT last_name, employee_id, salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0),
       job_id, e.department_id
  /* Select all employees whose compensation is
  greater than that of Pataballa.*/
  FROM employees e, departments d
  /*The DEPARTMENTS table is used to get the department name.*/
  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
    AND salary + NVL(commission_pct,0) >   /* Subquery:       */
      (SELECT salary + NVL(commission_pct,0)
        /* total compensation is salary + commission_pct */
        FROM employees
        WHERE last_name = 'Pataballa')
  ORDER BY last_name, employee_id;
SELECT last_name,                                   -- select the name
       employee_id                                  -- employee id
       salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0),             -- total compensation
       job_id,                                      -- job
       e.department_id                              -- and department
  FROM employees e,                                 -- of all employees
       departments d
  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
    AND salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0) >           -- whose compensation
                                                    -- is greater than
        (SELECT salary + NVL(commission_pct,0)      -- the compensation
          FROM employees
          WHERE last_name = 'Pataballa')            -- of Pataballa
  ORDER BY last_name                                -- and order by last name
           employee_id                              -- and employee id.
;
```
## Comments on Schema and Nonschema Objects
You can use the `COMMENT` command to associate a comment with a schema object (table, view, materialized view, operator, indextype, mining model) or a nonschema object (edition) using the `COMMENT` command. You can also create a comment on a column, which is part of a table schema object. Comments associated with schema and nonschema objects are stored in the data dictionary. Refer to COMMENT for a description of this form of comment.
## Hints
Hints are comments in a SQL statement that pass instructions to the Oracle Database optimizer. The optimizer uses these hints to choose an execution plan for the statement, unless some condition exists that prevents the optimizer from doing so.
Hints were introduced in Oracle7, when users had little recourse if the optimizer generated suboptimal plans. Now Oracle provides a number of tools, including the SQL Tuning Advisor, SQL plan management, and SQL Performance Analyzer, to help you address performance problems that are not solved by the optimizer. Oracle strongly recommends that you use those tools rather than hints. The tools are far superior to hints, because when used on an ongoing basis, they provide fresh solutions as your data and database environment change.
Hints should be used sparingly, and only after you have collected statistics on the relevant tables and evaluated the optimizer plan without hints using the `EXPLAIN PLAN` statement. Changing database conditions as well as query performance enhancements in subsequent releases can have significant impact on how hints in your code affect performance.
The remainder of this section provides information on some commonly used hints. If you decide to use hints rather than the more advanced tuning tools, be aware that any short-term benefit resulting from the use of hints may not continue to result in improved performance over the long term.
**Using Hints**
A statement block can have only one comment containing hints, and that comment must follow the `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE`, or `DELETE` keyword.
The following syntax diagram shows hints contained in both styles of comments that Oracle supports within a statement block. The hint syntax must follow immediately after an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`, or `MERGE` keyword that begins the statement block.
***hint*::=**
Description of the illustration hint.gif
Description of the illustration hint.eps
where:
- The plus sign (+) causes Oracle to interpret the comment as a list of hints. The plus sign must follow immediately after the comment delimiter. No space is permitted.
**
- hint is one of the hints discussed in this section. The space between the plus sign and the hint is optional. If the comment contains multiple hints, then separate the hints by at least one space.
**
- string is other commenting text that can be interspersed with the hints.
The `--+` syntax requires that the entire comment be on a single line.
Oracle Database ignores hints and does not return an error under the following circumstances:
- The hint contains misspellings or syntax errors. However, the database does consider other correctly specified hints in the same comment.
``````````
- The comment containing the hint does not follow a DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, SELECT, or UPDATE keyword.
- A combination of hints conflict with each other. However, the database does consider other hints in the same comment.
- The database environment uses PL/SQL version 1, such as Forms version 3 triggers, Oracle Forms 4.5, and Oracle Reports 2.5.
- A global hint refers to multiple query blocks. Refer to Specifying Multiple Query Blocks in a Global Hint for more information.
With 19c you can use `DBMS_XPLAN` to find out whether a hint is used or not used. For more information, see the *Database SQL Tuning Guide*.
**Specifying a Query Block in a Hint**
You can specify an optional query block name in many hints to specify the query block to which the hint applies. This syntax lets you specify in the outer query a hint that applies to an inline view.
The syntax of the query block argument is of the form `@`*queryblock*, where *queryblock* is an identifier that specifies a query block in the query. The *queryblock* identifier can either be system-generated or user-specified. When you specify a hint in the query block itself to which the hint applies, you omit the *@queryblock* syntax.
``````````
- The system-generated identifier can be obtained by using EXPLAIN PLAN for the query. Pretransformation query block names can be determined by running EXPLAIN PLAN for the query using the NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION hint. See NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION Hint.
- The user-specified name can be set with the QB_NAME hint. See QB_NAME Hint.
**Specifying Global Hints**
Many hints can apply both to specific tables or indexes and more globally to tables within a view or to columns that are part of indexes. The syntactic elements *tablespec* and *indexspec* define these **global hints**.
***tablespec*::=**
Description of the illustration tablespec.gif
Description of the illustration tablespec.eps
You must specify the table to be accessed exactly as it appears in the statement. If the statement uses an alias for the table, then use the alias rather than the table name in the hint. However, do not include the schema name with the table name within the hint, even if the schema name appears in the statement.
 **Note:**   Specifying a global hint using the *tablespec* clause does not work for queries that use ANSI joins, because the optimizer generates additional views during parsing. Instead, specify `@`*queryblock* to indicate the query block to which the hint applies.
***indexspec*::=**
Description of the illustration indexspec.gif
Description of the illustration indexspec.eps
When *tablespec* is followed by *indexspec* in the specification of a hint, a comma separating the table name and index name is permitted but not required. Commas are also permitted, but not required, to separate multiple occurrences of *indexspec*.
**Specifying Multiple Query Blocks in a Global Hint**
Oracle Database ignores global hints that refer to multiple query blocks. To avoid this issue, Oracle recommends that you specify the object alias in the hint instead of using *tablespec* and *indexspec*.
For example, consider the following view `v` and table `t`:
```
CREATE VIEW v AS
  SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.location_id
  FROM employees e, departments d
  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id;
CREATE TABLE t AS
  SELECT * from employees
  WHERE employee_id < 200;
```
**Note:**   The following examples use the `EXPLAIN` `PLAN` statement, which enables you to display the execution plan and determine if a hint is honored or ignored. Refer to EXPLAIN PLAN for more information.
The `LEADING` hint is ignored in the following query because it refers to multiple query blocks, that is, the main query block containing table `t` and the view query block `v`:
```
EXPLAIN PLAN
  SET STATEMENT_ID = 'Test 1'
  INTO plan_table FOR
    (SELECT **/*+ LEADING(v.e v.d t) */** *
     FROM t, v
     WHERE t.department_id = v.department_id);
```
The following `SELECT` statement returns the execution plan, which shows that the `LEADING` hint was ignored:
```
SELECT id, LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1))||operation operation, options, object_name,  object_alias
  FROM plan_table
  START WITH id = 0 AND statement_id = 'Test 1'
  CONNECT BY PRIOR id = parent_id AND statement_id = 'Test 1'
  ORDER BY id;
 ID OPERATION            OPTIONS    OBJECT_NAME   OBJECT_ALIAS
--- -------------------- ---------- ------------- --------------------
  0 SELECT STATEMENT
  1   HASH JOIN
  2     HASH JOIN
  3       TABLE ACCESS   FULL       **DEPARTMENTS**   **D@SEL$2**
  4       TABLE ACCESS   FULL       **EMPLOYEES**     **E@SEL$2**
  5     TABLE ACCESS     FULL       **T**             **T@SEL$1**
```
The `LEADING` hint is honored in the following query because it refers to object aliases, which can be found in the execution plan that was returned by the previous query:
```
EXPLAIN PLAN
  SET STATEMENT_ID = 'Test 2'
  INTO plan_table FOR
    (SELECT **/*+ LEADING(E@SEL$2 D@SEL$2 T@SEL$1) */** *
     FROM t, v
     WHERE t.department_id = v.department_id);
```
The following `SELECT` statement returns the execution plan, which shows that the `LEADING` hint was honored:
```
SELECT id, LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1))||operation operation, options,
  object_name, object_alias
  FROM plan_table
  START WITH id = 0 AND statement_id = 'Test 2'
  CONNECT BY PRIOR id = parent_id AND statement_id = 'Test 2'
  ORDER BY id;

  5     TABLE ACCESS     FULL       **T**             **T@SEL$1**
```

## Alphabetical Listing of Hints
This section provides syntax and semantics for all hints in alphabetical order.
### ALL_ROWS Hint
Description of the illustration all_rows_hint.gif
Description of the illustration all_rows_hint.eps
The `ALL_ROWS` hint instructs the optimizer to optimize a statement block with a goal of best throughput, which is minimum total resource consumption. For example, the optimizer uses the query optimization approach to optimize this statement for best throughput:
```
SELECT /*+ ALL_ROWS */ employee_id, last_name, salary, job_id
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = 107;
```
If you specify either the `ALL_ROWS` or the `FIRST_ROWS` hint in a SQL statement, and if the data dictionary does not have statistics about tables accessed by the statement, then the optimizer uses default statistical values, such as allocated storage for such tables, to estimate the missing statistics and to subsequently choose an execution plan. These estimates might not be as accurate as those gathered by the `DBMS_STATS` package, so you should use the `DBMS_STATS` package to gather statistics.
If you specify hints for access paths or join operations along with either the `ALL_ROWS` or `FIRST_ROWS` hint, then the optimizer gives precedence to the access paths and join operations specified by the hints.
### APPEND Hint
Description of the illustration append_hint.gif
Description of the illustration append_hint.eps
The `APPEND` hint instructs the optimizer to use direct-path `INSERT` with the subquery syntax of the `INSERT` statement.
````
- Conventional INSERT is the default in serial mode. In serial mode, direct path can be used only if you include the APPEND hint.
````
- Direct-path INSERT is the default in parallel mode. In parallel mode, conventional insert can be used only if you specify the NOAPPEND hint.
The decision whether the `INSERT` will go parallel or not is independent of the `APPEND` hint.
In direct-path `INSERT`, data is appended to the end of the table, rather than using existing space currently allocated to the table. As a result, direct-path `INSERT` can be considerably faster than conventional `INSERT`.
The `APPEND` hint is only supported with the subquery syntax of the `INSERT` statement, not the `VALUES` clause. If you specify the `APPEND` hint with the `VALUES` clause, it is ignored and conventional insert will be used. To use direct-path `INSERT` with the `VALUES` clause, refer to “APPEND_VALUES Hint”.
**See Also:**   NOAPPEND Hint for information on that hint and *Oracle Database Administrator’s Guide* for information on direct-path inserts
### APPEND_VALUES Hint
Description of the illustration append_values_hint.gif
Description of the illustration append_values_hint.eps
The `APPEND_VALUES` hint instructs the optimizer to use direct-path `INSERT` with the `VALUES` clause. If you do not specify this hint, then conventional `INSERT` is used.
In direct-path `INSERT`, data is appended to the end of the table, rather than using existing space currently allocated to the table. As a result, direct-path `INSERT` can be considerably faster than conventional `INSERT`.
The `APPEND_VALUES` hint can be used to greatly enhance performance. Some examples of its uses are:
- In an Oracle Call Interface (OCI) program, when using large array binds or array binds with row callbacks
``````
- In PL/SQL, when loading a large number of rows with a FORALL loop that has an INSERT statement with a VALUES clause
The `APPEND_VALUES` hint is only supported with the `VALUES` clause of the `INSERT` statement. If you specify the `APPEND_VALUES` hint with the subquery syntax of the `INSERT` statement, it is ignored and conventional insert will be used. To use direct-path `INSERT` with a subquery, refer to “APPEND Hint”.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Administrator’s Guide* for information on direct-path inserts
### CACHE Hint
Description of the illustration cache_hint.gif
Description of the illustration cache_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `CACHE` hint instructs the optimizer to place the blocks retrieved for the table at the most recently used end of the LRU list in the buffer cache when a full table scan is performed. This hint is useful for small lookup tables.
In the following example, the `CACHE` hint overrides the default caching specification of the table:
```
SELECT /*+ FULL (hr_emp) CACHE(hr_emp) */ last_name
  FROM employees hr_emp;
```
The `CACHE` and `NOCACHE` hints affect system statistics `table scans (long tables)` and `table scans (short tables)`, as shown in the `V$SYSSTAT` data dictionary view.
### CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX Hint
Description of the illustration change_dupkey_error_index.gif
Description of the illustration change_dupkey_error_index.eps
**Note:**   The `CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX`, `IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX`, and `RETRY_ON_ROW_CHANGE` hints are unlike other hints in that they have a semantic effect. The general philosophy explained in Hints does not apply for these three hints.
The `CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX` hint provides a mechanism to unambiguously identify a unique key violation for a specified set of columns or for a specified index. When a unique key violation occurs for the specified index, an ORA-38911 error is reported instead of an ORA-
001.
This hint applies to `INSERT`, `UPDATE` operations. If you specify an index, then the index must exist and be unique. If you specify a column list instead of an index, then a unique index whose columns match the specified columns in number and order must exist.
This use of this hint results in error messages if specific rules are violated. Refer to IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX Hint for details.
 **Note:**   This hint disables both `APPEND` mode and parallel DML.
### CLUSTER Hint
Description of the illustration cluster_hint.gif
Description of the illustration cluster_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `CLUSTER` hint instructs the optimizer to use a cluster scan to access the specified table. This hint applies only to tables in an indexed cluster.
### CLUSTERING Hint
Description of the illustration clustering_hint.gif
Description of the illustration clustering_hint.eps
This hint is valid only for `INSERT` and `MERGE` operations on tables that are enabled for attribute clustering. The `CLUSTERING` hint enables attribute clustering for direct-path inserts (serial or parallel). This results in partially-clustered data, that is, data that is clustered per each insert or merge operation. This hint overrides a `NO` `ON` `LOAD` setting in the DDL that created or altered the table. This hint has no effect on tables that are not enabled for attribute clustering.

  - [NO_CLUSTERING Hint](Comments.html#GUID-48179E54-E6DB-462B-BD8D-978B3340CFD1)
  </div>
```
### CONTAINERS Hint
Description of the illustration containers_hint.eps
The `CONTAINERS` hint is useful in a multitenant container database (CDB). You can specify this hint in a `SELECT` statement that contains the `CONTAINERS()` clause. Such a statement lets you query data in the specified table or view across all containers in a CDB or application container.
- To query data in a CDB, you must be a common user connected to the CDB root, and the table or view must exist in the root and all PDBs. The query returns all rows from the table or view in the CDB root and in all open PDBs.
- To query data in an application container, you must be a common user connected to the application root, and the table or view must exist in the application root and all PDBs in the application container. The query returns all rows from the table or view in the application root and in all open PDBs in the application container.
Statements that contain the `CONTAINERS()` clause generate and execute recursive SQL statements in each queried PDB. You can use the `CONTAINERS` hint to pass a default PDB hint to each recursive SQL statement. For *hint*, you can specify any SQL hint that is appropriate for the `SELECT` statement.
In the following example, the `NO_PARALLEL` hint is passed to each recursive SQL statement that is executed as part of the evaluation of the `CONTAINERS()` clause:
```
SELECT /*+ CONTAINERS(DEFAULT_PDB_HINT='NO_PARALLEL') */
  (CASE WHEN COUNT(*) < 10000
        THEN 'Less than 10,000'
        ELSE '10,000 or more' END) "Number of Tables"
  FROM CONTAINERS(DBA_TABLES);
```
**See Also:**   *containers_clause* for more information on the `CONTAINERS()` clause
### CURSOR_SHARING_EXACT Hint
Description of the illustration cursor_sharing_exact_hint.gif
Description of the illustration cursor_sharing_exact_hint.eps
Oracle can replace literals in SQL statements with bind variables, when it is safe to do so. This replacement is controlled with the `CURSOR_SHARING` initialization parameter. The `CURSOR_SHARING_EXACT` hint instructs the optimizer to switch this behavior off. When you specify this hint, Oracle executes the SQL statement without any attempt to replace literals with bind variables.
### DISABLE_PARALLEL_DML Hint
Description of the illustration disable_parallel_dml_hint.eps
The `DISABLE_PARALLEL_DML` hint disables parallel DML for `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE`, and `UPDATE` statements. You can use this hint to disable parallel DML for an individual statement when parallel DML is enabled for the session with the `ALTER` `SESSION` `ENABLE` `PARALLEL` `DML` statement.
### DRIVING_SITE Hint
Description of the illustration driving_site_hint.gif
Description of the illustration driving_site_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `DRIVING_SITE` hint instructs the optimizer to execute the query at a different site than that selected by the database. This hint is useful if you are using distributed query optimization.
For example:
```
SELECT /*+ DRIVING_SITE(departments) */ *
  FROM employees, departments@rsite
  WHERE employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
If this query is executed without the hint, then rows from `departments` are sent to the local site, and the join is executed there. With the hint, the rows from `employees` are sent to the remote site, and the query is executed there and the result set is returned to the local site.
### DYNAMIC_SAMPLING Hint
Description of the illustration dynamic_sampling_hint.gif
Description of the illustration dynamic_sampling_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `DYNAMIC_SAMPLING` hint instructs the optimizer how to control dynamic sampling to improve server performance by determining more accurate predicate selectivity and statistics for tables and indexes.
You can set the value of `DYNAMIC_SAMPLING` to a value from 0 to
  **- The higher the level, the more effort the compiler puts into dynamic sampling and the more broadly it is applied. Sampling defaults to cursor level unless you specify tablespec.
The *integer* value is `0` to `10,` indicating the degree of sampling.
If a cardinality statistic already exists for the table, then the optimizer uses it. Otherwise, the optimizer enables dynamic sampling to estimate the cardinality statistic.
If you specify *tablespec* and the cardinality statistic already exists, then:
  ````- If there is no single-table predicate (a WHERE clause that evaluates only one table), then the optimizer trusts the existing statistics and ignores this hint. For example, the following query will not result in any dynamic sampling if employees is analyzed:
```
SELECT /*+ DYNAMIC_SAMPLING(e 1) */ count(*)
  FROM employees e;
```
  - If there is a single-table predicate, then the optimizer uses the existing cardinality statistic and estimates the selectivity of the predicate using the existing statistics.
To apply dynamic sampling to a specific table, use the following form of the hint:
```
SELECT /*+ DYNAMIC_SAMPLING(employees 1) */ *
  FROM employees
  WHERE ...
```
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for information about dynamic sampling and the sampling levels that you can set
### ENABLE_PARALLEL_DML Hint
Description of the illustration enable_parallel_dml_hint.eps
The `ENABLE_PARALLEL_DML` hint enables parallel DML for `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE`, and `UPDATE` statements. You can use this hint to enable parallel DML for an individual statement, rather than enabling parallel DML for the session with the `ALTER` `SESSION` `ENABLE` `PARALLEL` `DML` statement.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database VLDB and Partitioning Guide* for information about enabling parallel DML
### FACT Hint
Description of the illustration fact_hint.gif
Description of the illustration fact_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `FACT` hint is used in the context of the star transformation. It instructs the optimizer that the table specified in *tablespec* should be considered as a fact table.
### FIRST_ROWS Hint
Description of the illustration first_rows_hint.gif
Description of the illustration first_rows_hint.eps
The `FIRST_ROWS` hint instructs Oracle to optimize an individual SQL statement for fast response, choosing the plan that returns the first *n* rows most efficiently. For *integer*, specify the number of rows to return.
For example, the optimizer uses the query optimization approach to optimize the following statement for best response time:
```
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(10) */ employee_id, last_name, salary, job_id
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id = 20;
```
In this example each department contains many employees. The user wants the first 10 employees of department 20 to be displayed as quickly as possible.
The optimizer ignores this hint in `DELETE` and `UPDATE` statement blocks and in `SELECT` statement blocks that include any blocking operations, such as sorts or groupings. Such statements cannot be optimized for best response time, because Oracle Database must retrieve all rows accessed by the statement before returning the first row. If you specify this hint in any such statement, then the database optimizes for best throughput.
**See Also:**   ALL_ROWS Hint for additional information on the `FIRST_ROWS` hint and statistics
### FRESH_MV Hint
Description of the illustration fresh_mv_hint.eps
The `FRESH_MV` hint applies when querying a real-time materialized view. This hint instructs the optimizer to use on-query computation to fetch up-to-date data from the materialized view, even if the materialized view is stale.
The optimizer ignores this hint in `SELECT` statement blocks that query an object that is not a real-time materialized view, and in all `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE`, and `DELETE` statement blocks.
**See Also:**   The { ENABLE | DISABLE } ON QUERY COMPUTATION clause of `CREATE` `MATERIALIZED` `VIEW` for more information on real-time materialized views
### FULL Hint
Description of the illustration full_hint.gif
Description of the illustration full_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `FULL` hint instructs the optimizer to perform a full table scan for the specified table. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ FULL(e) */ employee_id, last_name
  FROM hr.employees e
  WHERE last_name LIKE :b1;
```
Oracle Database performs a full table scan on the `employees` table to execute this statement, even if there is an index on the `last_name` column that is made available by the condition in the `WHERE` clause.
The `employees` table has alias `e` in the `FROM` clause, so the hint must refer to the table by its alias rather than by its name. Do not specify schema names in the hint even if they are specified in the `FROM` clause.
### GATHER_OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS Hint
Description of the illustration gather_opt_stats_hint.gif
Description of the illustration gather_opt_stats_hint.eps
The `GATHER_OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS` hint instructs the optimizer to enable statistics gathering during the following types of bulk loads:
````````
- CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT
``````******
- INSERT INTO ... SELECT into an empty table using a direct-path insert See Also: Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide for more information on statistics gathering for bulk loads
### GROUPING Hint
Description of the illustration grouping_hint.eps
The `GROUPING` hint applies to data mining scoring functions when scoring partitioned models. This hint results in partitioning the input data set into distinct data slices so that each partition is scored in its entirety before advancing to the next partition; however, parallelism by partition is still available. Data slices are determined by the partitioning key columns that were used when the model was built. This method can be used with any data mining function against a partitioned model. The hint may yield a query performance gain when scoring large data that is associated with many partitions, but may negatively impact performance when scoring large data with few partitions on large systems. Typically, there is no performance gain if you use this hint for single row queries.
In the following example, the `GROUPING` hint is used in the `PREDICTION` function.
```
SELECT PREDICTION(/*+ GROUPING */my_model USING *) pred FROM <input table>;
```
**See Also:**   Data Mining Functions
### HASH Hint
Description of the illustration hash_hint.gif
Description of the illustration hash_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `HASH` hint instructs the optimizer to use a hash scan to access the specified table. This hint applies only to tables in a hash cluster.
### IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX Hint
Description of the illustration ignore_row_on_dupkey_index.gif
Description of the illustration ignore_row_on_dupkey_index.eps
**Note:**   The `CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX`, `IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX`, and `RETRY_ON_ROW_CHANGE` hints are unlike other hints in that they have a semantic effect. The general philosophy explained in Hints does not apply for these three hints.
The `IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX` hint applies only to single-table `INSERT` operations. It is not supported for `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, or multitable insert operations. `IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX` causes the statement to ignore a unique key violation for a specified set of columns or for a specified index. When a unique key violation is encountered, a row-level rollback occurs and execution resumes with the next input row. If you specify this hint when inserting data with DML error logging enabled, then the unique key violation is not logged and does not cause statement termination.
The semantic effect of this hint results in error messages if specific rules are violated:
**
- If you specify index, then the index must exist and be unique. Otherwise, the statement causes ORA- 38913.
- You must specify exactly one index. If you specify no index, then the statement causes ORA-38912. If you specify more than one index, then the statement causes ORA-38915.
``````
- You can specify either a CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX or IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX hint in an INSERT statement, but not both. If you specify both, then the statement causes ORA-38915.
As with all hints, a syntax error in the hint causes it to be silently ignored. The result will be that ORA-00001 will be caused, just as if no hint were used.
 **Note:**   This hint disables both `APPEND` mode and parallel `DML`.
**See Also:**   CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX Hint
### INDEX Hint
Description of the illustration index_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX` hint instructs the optimizer to use an index scan for the specified table. You can use the `INDEX` hint for function-based, domain, B-tree, bitmap, and bitmap join indexes.
The behavior of the hint depends on the *indexspec* specification:
- If the INDEX hint specifies a single available index, then the database performs a scan on this index. The optimizer does not consider a full table scan or a scan of another index on the table.
``````
- For a hint on a combination of multiple indexes, Oracle recommends using INDEX_COMBINE rather than INDEX, because it is a more versatile hint. If the INDEX hint specifies a list of available indexes, then the optimizer considers the cost of a scan on each index in the list and then performs the index scan with the lowest cost. The database can also choose to scan multiple indexes from this list and merge the results, if such an access path has the lowest cost. The database does not consider a full table scan or a scan on an index not listed in the hint.
- If the INDEX hint specifies no indexes, then the optimizer considers the cost of a scan on each available index on the table and then performs the index scan with the lowest cost. The database can also choose to scan multiple indexes and merge the results, if such an access path has the lowest cost. The optimizer does not consider a full table scan.
For example:
```
SELECT /*+ INDEX (employees emp_department_ix)*/ employee_id, department_id
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id > 50;
```
### INDEX_ASC Hint
Description of the illustration index_asc_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_asc_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_ASC` hint instructs the optimizer to use an index scan for the specified table. If the statement uses an index range scan, then Oracle Database scans the index entries in ascending order of their indexed values. Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint.
The default behavior for a range scan is to scan index entries in ascending order of their indexed values, or in descending order for a descending index. This hint does not change the default order of the index, and therefore does not specify anything more than the `INDEX` hint. However, you can use the `INDEX_ASC` hint to specify ascending range scans explicitly should the default behavior change.
### INDEX_COMBINE Hint
Description of the illustration index_combine_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_combine_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_COMBINE` hint can use any type of index: bitmap, b-tree, or domain. If you do not specify *indexspec* in the `INDEX_COMBINE` hint, the optimizer implicitly applies the`INDEX` hint to all indexes, using as many indexes as possible. If you specify *indexspec*, then the optimizer uses all the hinted indexes that are legal and valid to use, regardless of cost. Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ INDEX_COMBINE(e emp_manager_ix emp_department_ix) */ *
  FROM employees e
  WHERE manager_id = 108
     OR department_id = 110;
```
### INDEX_DESC Hint
Description of the illustration index_desc_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_desc_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_DESC` hint instructs the optimizer to use a descending index scan for the specified table. If the statement uses an index range scan and the index is ascending, then Oracle scans the index entries in descending order of their indexed values. In a partitioned index, the results are in descending order within each partition. For a descending index, this hint effectively cancels out the descending order, resulting in a scan of the index entries in ascending order. Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ INDEX_DESC(e emp_name_ix) */ *
  FROM employees e;
```
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for information on full scans
### INDEX_FFS Hint
Description of the illustration index_ffs_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_ffs_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_FFS` hint instructs the optimizer to perform a fast full index scan rather than a full table scan.
Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ INDEX_FFS(e emp_name_ix) */ first_name
  FROM employees e;
```
### INDEX_JOIN Hint
Description of the illustration index_join_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_join_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_JOIN` hint instructs the optimizer to use an index join as an access path. For the hint to have a positive effect, a sufficiently small number of indexes must exist that contain all the columns required to resolve the query.
Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint. For example, the following query uses an index join to access the `manager_id` and `department_id` columns, both of which are indexed in the `employees` table.
```
SELECT /*+ INDEX_JOIN(e emp_manager_ix emp_department_ix) */ department_id
  FROM employees e
  WHERE manager_id < 110
    AND department_id < 50;
```
### INDEX_SS Hint
Description of the illustration index_ss_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_ss_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_SS` hint instructs the optimizer to perform an index skip scan for the specified table. If the statement uses an index range scan, then Oracle scans the index entries in ascending order of their indexed values. In a partitioned index, the results are in ascending order within each partition.
Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ INDEX_SS(e emp_name_ix) */ last_name
  FROM employees e
  WHERE first_name = 'Steven';
```
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for information on index skip scans
### INDEX_SS_ASC Hint
Description of the illustration index_ss_asc_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_ss_asc_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_SS_ASC` hint instructs the optimizer to perform an index skip scan for the specified table. If the statement uses an index range scan, then Oracle Database scans the index entries in ascending order of their indexed values. In a partitioned index, the results are in ascending order within each partition. Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint.
The default behavior for a range scan is to scan index entries in ascending order of their indexed values, or in descending order for a descending index. This hint does not change the default order of the index, and therefore does not specify anything more than the `INDEX_SS` hint. However, you can use the `INDEX_SS_ASC` hint to specify ascending range scans explicitly should the default behavior change.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for information on index skip scans
### INDEX_SS_DESC Hint
Description of the illustration index_ss_desc_hint.gif
Description of the illustration index_ss_desc_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `INDEX_SS_DESC` hint instructs the optimizer to perform an index skip scan for the specified table. If the statement uses an index range scan and the index is ascending, then Oracle scans the index entries in descending order of their indexed values. In a partitioned index, the results are in descending order within each partition. For a descending index, this hint effectively cancels out the descending order, resulting in a scan of the index entries in ascending order.
Each parameter serves the same purpose as in the INDEX Hint. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ INDEX_SS_DESC(e emp_name_ix) */ last_name
  FROM employees e
  WHERE first_name = 'Steven';
```
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for information on index skip scans
### INMEMORY Hint
Description of the illustration inmemory_hint.gif
Description of the illustration inmemory_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `INMEMORY` hint enables In-Memory queries.
This hint does not instruct the optimizer to perform a full table scan. If a full table scan is desired, then also specify the FULL Hint.
### INMEMORY_PRUNING Hint
Description of the illustration inmemory_pruning_hint.gif
Description of the illustration inmemory_pruning_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `INMEMORY_PRUNING` hint enables pruning of In-Memory queries.
### LEADING Hint
Description of the illustration leading_hint.gif
Description of the illustration leading_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `LEADING` hint is a multitable hint that can specify more than one table or view. `LEADING` instructs the optimizer to use the specified set of tables as the prefix in the execution plan. The first table specified is used to start the join.
This hint is more versatile than the `ORDERED` hint. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ LEADING(e j) */ *
    FROM employees e, departments d, job_history j
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
      AND e.hire_date = j.start_date;
```
The `LEADING` hint is ignored if the tables specified cannot be joined first in the order specified because of dependencies in the join graph. If you specify two or more conflicting `LEADING` hints, then all of them are ignored. If you specify the `ORDERED` hint, it overrides all `LEADING` hints.
### MERGE Hint
Description of the illustration merge_hint.gif
Description of the illustration merge_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `MERGE` hint lets you merge views in a query.
If a view’s query block contains a `GROUP` `BY` clause or `DISTINCT` operator in the `SELECT` list, then the optimizer can merge the view into the accessing statement only if complex view merging is enabled. Complex merging can also be used to merge an `IN` subquery into the accessing statement if the subquery is uncorrelated.
For example:
```
SELECT /*+ MERGE(v) */ e1.last_name, e1.salary, v.avg_salary
   FROM employees e1,
        (SELECT department_id, avg(salary) avg_salary
           FROM employees e2
           GROUP BY department_id) v
   WHERE e1.department_id = v.department_id
     AND e1.salary > v.avg_salary
   ORDER BY e1.last_name;
```
When the `MERGE` hint is used without an argument, it should be placed in the view query block. When `MERGE` is used with the view name as an argument, it should be placed in the surrounding query.
### MODEL_MIN_ANALYSIS Hint
Description of the illustration model_min_analysis_hint.gif
Description of the illustration model_min_analysis_hint.eps
The `MODEL_MIN_ANALYSIS` hint instructs the optimizer to omit some compile-time optimizations of spreadsheet rules-primarily detailed dependency graph analysis. Other spreadsheet optimizations, such as creating filters to selectively populate spreadsheet access structures and limited rule pruning, are still used by the optimizer.
This hint reduces compilation time because spreadsheet analysis can be lengthy if the number of spreadsheet rules is more than several hundreds.
### MONITOR Hint
Description of the illustration monitor_hint.gif
Description of the illustration monitor_hint.eps
The `MONITOR` hint forces real-time SQL monitoring for the query, even if the statement is not long running. This hint is valid only when the parameter `CONTROL_MANAGEMENT_PACK_ACCESS` is set to `DIAGNOSTIC+TUNING`.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for more information about real-time SQL monitoring
### NATIVE_FULL_OUTER_JOIN Hint
Description of the illustration native_foj_hint.gif
Description of the illustration native_foj_hint.eps
The `NATIVE_FULL_OUTER_JOIN` hint instructs the optimizer to use native full outer join, which is a native execution method based on a hash join.
```

  </div>
```
### NOAPPEND Hint
Description of the illustration noappend_hint.gif
Description of the illustration noappend_hint.eps
The `NOAPPEND` hint instructs the optimizer to use conventional `INSERT` by disabling parallel mode for the duration of the `INSERT` statement. Conventional `INSERT` is the default in serial mode, and direct-path `INSERT` is the default in parallel mode.
### NOCACHE Hint
Description of the illustration nocache_hint.gif
Description of the illustration nocache_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NOCACHE` hint instructs the optimizer to place the blocks retrieved for the table at the least recently used end of the LRU list in the buffer cache when a full table scan is performed. This is the normal behavior of blocks in the buffer cache. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ FULL(hr_emp) NOCACHE(hr_emp) */ last_name
  FROM employees hr_emp;
```
The `CACHE` and `NOCACHE` hints affect system statistics `table` `scans(long` `tables)` and `table` `scans(short` `tables)`, as shown in the `V$SYSSTAT` view.
### NO_CLUSTERING Hint
Description of the illustration no_clustering_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_clustering_hint.eps
This hint is valid only for `INSERT` and `MERGE` operations on tables that are enabled for attribute clustering. The `NO_CLUSTERING` hint disables attribute clustering for direct-path inserts (serial or parallel). This hint overrides a `YES` `ON` `LOAD` setting in the DDL that created or altered the table. This hint has no effect on tables that are not enabled for attribute clustering.
**See Also:**
**``````````

- CLUSTERING Hint
### NO_EXPAND Hint
Description of the illustration no_expand_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_expand_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `NO_EXPAND` hint instructs the optimizer not to consider `OR`-expansion for queries having `OR` conditions or `IN`-lists in the `WHERE` clause. Usually, the optimizer considers using `OR` expansion and uses this method if it decides that the cost is lower than not using it. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_EXPAND */ *
  FROM employees e, departments d
  WHERE e.manager_id = 108
     OR d.department_id = 110;
```
**See Also:**   The USE_CONCAT Hint, which is the opposite of this hint
### NO_FACT Hint
Description of the illustration no_fact_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_fact_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_FACT` hint is used in the context of the star transformation. It instruct the optimizer that the queried table should not be considered as a fact table.
### NO_GATHER_OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS Hint
Description of the illustration no_gather_opt_stats_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_gather_opt_stats_hint.eps
The `NO_GATHER_OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS` hint instructs the optimizer to disable statistics gathering during the following types of bulk loads:
````````
- CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
``````
- INSERT INTO ... SELECT into an empty table using a direct path insert
The `NO_GATHER_OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS` hint is applicable to a conventional load. If this hint is specified in the conventional insert statement, Oracle will obey the hint and not collect real-time statistics.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for more information on online statistics gathering for conventional loads.
### NO_INDEX Hint
Description of the illustration no_index_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_index_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `NO_INDEX` hint instructs the optimizer not to use one or more indexes for the specified table. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_INDEX(employees emp_empid) */ employee_id
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id > 200;
```
Each parameter serves the same purpose as in INDEX Hint with the following modifications:
- If this hint specifies a single available index, then the optimizer does not consider a scan on this index. Other indexes not specified are still considered.
- If this hint specifies a list of available indexes, then the optimizer does not consider a scan on any of the specified indexes. Other indexes not specified in the list are still considered.
- If this hint specifies no indexes, then the optimizer does not consider a scan on any index on the table. This behavior is the same as a NO_INDEX hint that specifies a list of all available indexes for the table.
The `NO_INDEX` hint applies to function-based, B-tree, bitmap, cluster, or domain indexes. If a `NO_INDEX` hint and an index hint (`INDEX`, `INDEX_ASC`, `INDEX_DESC`, `INDEX_COMBINE`, or `INDEX_FFS`) both specify the same indexes, then the database ignores both the `NO_INDEX` hint and the index hint for the specified indexes and considers those indexes for use during execution of the statement.
### NO_INDEX_FFS Hint
Description of the illustration no_index_ffs_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_index_ffs_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `NO_INDEX_FFS` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude a fast full index scan of the specified indexes on the specified table. Each parameter serves the same purpose as in the NO_INDEX Hint. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_INDEX_FFS(items item_order_ix) */ order_id
  FROM order_items items;
```
### NO_INDEX_SS Hint
Description of the illustration no_index_ss_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_index_ss_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `NO_INDEX_SS` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude a skip scan of the specified indexes on the specified table. Each parameter serves the same purpose as in the NO_INDEX Hint.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide* for information on index skip scans
### NO_INMEMORY Hint
Description of the illustration no_inmemory_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_inmemory_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_INMEMORY` hint disables In-Memory queries.
### NO_INMEMORY_PRUNING Hint
Description of the illustration no_inmemory_pruning_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_inmemory_pruning_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_INMEMORY_PRUNING` hint disables pruning of In-Memory queries.
### NO_MERGE Hint
Description of the illustration no_merge_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_merge_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_MERGE` hint instructs the optimizer not to combine the outer query and any inline view queries into a single query.
This hint lets you have more influence over the way in which the view is accessed. For example, the following statement causes view `seattle_dept` not to be merged:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE(seattle_dept) */ e1.last_name, seattle_dept.department_name
  FROM employees e1,
       (SELECT location_id, department_id, department_name
          FROM departments
          WHERE location_id = 1700) seattle_dept
  WHERE e1.department_id = seattle_dept.department_id;
```
When you use the `NO_MERGE` hint in the view query block, specify it without an argument. When you specify `NO_MERGE` in the surrounding query, specify it with the view name as an argument.
### NO_MONITOR Hint
Description of the illustration no_monitor_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_monitor_hint.eps
The `NO_MONITOR` hint disables real-time SQL monitoring for the query, even if the query is long running.
### NO_NATIVE_FULL_OUTER_JOIN Hint
Description of the illustration no_native_foj_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_native_foj_hint.eps
The `NO_NATIVE_FULL_OUTER_JOIN` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude the native execution method when joining each specified table. Instead, the full outer join is executed as a union of left outer join and anti-join.
**See Also:**   NATIVE_FULL_OUTER_JOIN Hint
### NO_PARALLEL Hint
Description of the illustration no_parallel_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_parallel_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_PARALLEL` hint instructs the optimizer to run the statement serially. This hint overrides the value of the `PARALLEL_DEGREE_POLICY` initialization parameter. It also overrides a `PARALLEL` parameter in the DDL that created or altered the table. For example, the following `SELECT` statement will run serially:
```
ALTER TABLE employees PARALLEL 8;
SELECT /*+ NO_PARALLEL(hr_emp) */ last_name
  FROM employees hr_emp;
```
**See Also:**
- Note on Parallel Hints for more information on the parallel hints
**
- Oracle Database Reference for more information on the PARALLEL_DEGREE_POLICY initialization parameter
### NOPARALLEL Hint
The `NOPARALLEL` hint has been deprecated. Use the `NO_PARALLEL` hint instead.
### NO_PARALLEL_INDEX Hint
Description of the illustration no_parallel_index_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_parallel_index_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `NO_PARALLEL_INDEX` hint overrides a `PARALLEL` parameter in the DDL that created or altered the index, thus avoiding a parallel index scan operation.
**See Also:**   Note on Parallel Hints for more information on the parallel hints
### NOPARALLEL_INDEX Hint
The `NOPARALLEL_INDEX` hint has been deprecated. Use the `NO_PARALLEL_INDEX` hint instead.
### NO_PQ_CONCURRENT_UNION Hint
Description of the illustration no_pq_concurrent_union_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_pq_concurrent_union_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `NO_PQ_CONCURRENT_UNION` hint instructs the optimizer to disable concurrent processing of `UNION` and `UNION` `ALL` operations.
**See Also:**
- PQ_CONCURRENT_UNION Hint
**
- Oracle Database VLDB and Partitioning Guide for information about using this hint
### NO_PQ_SKEW Hint
Description of the illustration no_pq_skew_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_pq_skew_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_PQ_SKEW` hint advises the optimizer that the distribution of the values of the join keys for a parallel join is not skewed-that is, a high percentage of rows do not have the same join key values. The table specified in *tablespec* is the probe table of the hash join.
### NO_PUSH_PRED Hint
Description of the illustration no_push_pred_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_push_pred_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_PUSH_PRED` hint instructs the optimizer not to push a join predicate into the view. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE(v) NO_PUSH_PRED(v) */ *
  FROM employees e,
       (SELECT manager_id
          FROM employees) v
  WHERE e.manager_id = v.manager_id(+)
    AND e.employee_id = 100;
```
### NO_PUSH_SUBQ Hint
Description of the illustration no_push_subq_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_push_subq_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `NO_PUSH_SUBQ` hint instructs the optimizer to evaluate nonmerged subqueries as the last step in the execution plan. Doing so can improve performance if the subquery is relatively expensive or does not reduce the number of rows significantly.
### NO_PX_JOIN_FILTER Hint
Description of the illustration no_px_join_filter_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_px_join_filter_hint.eps
This hint prevents the optimizer from using parallel join bitmap filtering.
### NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION Hint
Description of the illustration no_query_transformatn_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_query_transformatn_hint.eps
The `NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint instructs the optimizer to skip all query transformations, including but not limited to `OR`-expansion, view merging, subquery unnesting, star transformation, and materialized view rewrite. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION */ employee_id, last_name
  FROM (SELECT * FROM employees e) v
  WHERE v.last_name = 'Smith';
```
### NO_RESULT_CACHE Hint
Description of the illustration no_result_cache_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_result_cache_hint.eps
The optimizer caches query results in the result cache if the `RESULT_CACHE_MODE` initialization parameter is set to `FORCE`. In this case, the `NO_RESULT_CACHE` hint disables such caching for the current query.
If the query is executed from OCI client and OCI client result cache is enabled, then the `NO_RESULT_CACHE` hint disables caching for the current query.
### NO_REWRITE Hint
Description of the illustration no_rewrite_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_rewrite_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `NO_REWRITE` hint instructs the optimizer to disable query rewrite for the query block, overriding the setting of the parameter `QUERY_REWRITE_ENABLED`. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_REWRITE */ sum(s.amount_sold) AS dollars
  FROM sales s, times t
  WHERE s.time_id = t.time_id
  GROUP BY t.calendar_month_desc;
```
### NOREWRITE Hint
The `NOREWRITE` hint has been deprecated. Use the `NO_REWRITE` hint instead.
### NO_STAR_TRANSFORMATION Hint
Description of the illustration no_star_transformation_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_star_transformation_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `NO_STAR_TRANSFORMATION` hint instructs the optimizer not to perform star query transformation.
### NO_STATEMENT_QUEUING Hint
Description of the illustration no_statement_queuing_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_statement_queuing_hint.eps
The `NO_STATEMENT_QUEUING` hint influences whether or not a statement is queued with parallel statement queuing.
When `PARALLEL_DEGREE_POLICY` is set to `AUTO`, this hint enables a statement to bypass the parallel statement queue. However, a statement that bypasses the statement queue can potentially cause the system to exceed the maximum number of parallel execution servers defined by the value of the `PARALLEL_SERVERS_TARGET` initialization parameter, which determines the limit at which parallel statement queuing is initiated.
There is no guarantee that the statement that bypasses the parallel statement queue receives the number of parallel execution servers requested because only the number of parallel execution servers available on the system, up to the value of the `PARALLEL_MAX_SERVERS` initialization parameter, can be allocated.
For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_STATEMENT_QUEUING */ emp.last_name, dpt.department_name
  FROM employees emp, departments dpt
  WHERE emp.department_id = dpt.department_id;
```
**See Also:**   STATEMENT_QUEUING Hint
### NO_UNNEST Hint
Description of the illustration no_unnest_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_unnest_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
Use of the `NO_UNNEST` hint turns off unnesting .
### NO_USE_BAND Hint
Description of the illustration no_use_band_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_USE_BAND` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude band joins when joining each specified table to another row source. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_USE_BAND(e1 e2) */
  e1.last_name

  || ' has salary between 100 less and 100 more than '
  || e2.last_name AS "SALARY COMPARISON"

FROM employees e1, employees e2
WHERE e1.salary BETWEEN e2.salary - 100 AND e2.salary + 100;
```
### NO_USE_CUBE Hint
Description of the illustration no_use_cube_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_use_cube_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_USE_CUBE` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude cube joins when joining each specified table to another row source using the specified table as the inner table.
### NO_USE_HASH Hint
Description of the illustration no_use_hash_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_use_hash_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_USE_HASH` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude hash joins when joining each specified table to another row source using the specified table as the inner table. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_USE_HASH(e d) */ *
  FROM employees e, departments d
  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
### NO_USE_MERGE Hint
Description of the illustration no_use_merge_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_use_merge_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_USE_MERGE` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude sort-merge joins when joining each specified table to another row source using the specified table as the inner table. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_USE_MERGE(e d) */ *
   FROM employees e, departments d
   WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
   ORDER BY d.department_id;
```
### NO_USE_NL Hint
Description of the illustration no_use_nl_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_use_nl_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_USE_NL` hint instructs the optimizer to exclude nested loops joins when joining each specified table to another row source using the specified table as the inner table. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_USE_NL(l h) */ *
  FROM orders h, order_items l
  WHERE l.order_id = h.order_id
    AND l.order_id > 2400;
```
When this hint is specified, only hash join and sort-merge joins are considered for the specified tables. However, in some cases tables can be joined only by using nested loops. In such cases, the optimizer ignores the hint for those tables.
### NO_XML_QUERY_REWRITE Hint
Description of the illustration no_xml_query_rewrite_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_xml_query_rewrite_hint.eps
The `NO_XML_QUERY_REWRITE` hint instructs the optimizer to prohibit the rewriting of XPath expressions in SQL statements. By prohibiting the rewriting of XPath expressions, this hint also prohibits the use of any XMLIndexes for the current query. For example:
```
SELECT /*+NO_XML_QUERY_REWRITE*/ XMLQUERY('<A/>' RETURNING CONTENT)
  FROM DUAL;
```
**See Also:**   NO_XMLINDEX_REWRITE Hint
### NO_XMLINDEX_REWRITE Hint
Description of the illustration no_xmlindex_rewrite_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_xmlindex_rewrite_hint.eps
The `NO_XMLINDEX_REWRITE` hint instructs the optimizer not to use any XMLIndex indexes for the current query. For example:
```
SELECT /*+NO_XMLINDEX_REWRITE*/ count(*)
  FROM warehouses
  WHERE existsNode(warehouse_spec, '/Warehouse/Building') = 1;
```
**See Also:**   NO_XML_QUERY_REWRITE Hint for another way to disable the use of XMLIndexes
### NO_ZONEMAP Hint
Description of the illustration no_zonemap_hint.gif
Description of the illustration no_zonemap_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `NO_ZONEMAP` hint disables the use of a zone map for different types of pruning. This hint overrides an `ENABLE` `PRUNING` setting in the DDL that created or altered the zone map.
Specify one of the following options:
- SCAN - Disables the use of a zone map for scan pruning.
- JOIN - Disables the use of a zone map for join pruning.
- PARTITION - Disables the use of a zone map for partition pruning.

### OPTIMIZER_FEATURES_ENABLE Hint
This hint is fully documented in the Database Reference book.
Please see Database Reference for details.
### OPT_PARAM Hint
Description of the illustration opt_param_hint.gif
Description of the illustration opt_param_hint.eps
The `OPT_PARAM` hint lets you set an initialization parameter for the duration of the current query only. This hint is valid only for the following parameters: `APPROX_FOR_AGGREGATION`, `APPROX_FOR_COUNT_DISTINCT`, `APPROX_FOR_PERCENTILE`, `OPTIMIZER_DYNAMIC_SAMPLING`, `OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING`, `OPTIMIZER_INDEX_COST_ADJ`, `OPTIMIZER_SECURE_VIEW_MERGING`, and `STAR_TRANSFORMATION_ENABLED`.
For example, the following hint sets the parameter `STAR_TRANSFORMATION_ENABLED` to `TRUE` for the statement to which it is added:
```
SELECT /*+ OPT_PARAM('star_transformation_enabled' 'true') */ *
  FROM ... ;
```
Parameter values that are strings are enclosed in single quotation marks. Numeric parameter values are specified without quotation marks.
### ORDERED Hint
Description of the illustration ordered_hint.gif
Description of the illustration ordered_hint.eps
The `ORDERED` hint instructs Oracle to join tables in the order in which they appear in the `FROM` clause. Oracle recommends that you use the `LEADING` hint, which is more versatile than the `ORDERED` hint.
When you omit the `ORDERED` hint from a SQL statement requiring a join, the optimizer chooses the order in which to join the tables. You might want to use the `ORDERED` hint to specify a join order if you know something that the optimizer does not know about the number of rows selected from each table. Such information lets you choose an inner and outer table better than the optimizer could.
The following query is an example of the use of the `ORDERED` hint:
```
SELECT  /*+ ORDERED */ o.order_id, c.customer_id, l.unit_price * l.quantity
  FROM customers c, order_items l, orders o
  WHERE c.cust_last_name = 'Taylor'
    AND o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    AND o.order_id = l.order_id;
```
### PARALLEL Hint
**Note on Parallel Hints**
Beginning with Oracle Database 11*g* Release 2, the `PARALLEL` and `NO_PARALLEL` hints are statement-level hints and supersede the earlier object-level hints: `PARALLEL_INDEX`, `NO_PARALLEL_INDEX`, and previously specified `PARALLEL` and `NO_PARALLEL` hints. For `PARALLEL`, if you specify *integer*, then that degree of parallelism will be used for the statement. If you omit *integer*, then the database computes the degree of parallelism. All the access paths that can use parallelism will use the specified or computed degree of parallelism.
In the syntax diagrams below, *parallel_hint_statement* shows the syntax for statement-level hints, and *parallel_hint_object* shows the syntax for object-level hints. Object-level hints are supported for backward compatibility, and are superseded by statement-level hints.

***parallel_hint_object*::=**
Description of the illustration parallel_hint_object.gif
Description of the illustration parallel_hint_object.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `PARALLEL` hint instructs the optimizer to use the specified number of concurrent servers for a parallel operation. This hint overrides the value of the `PARALLEL_DEGREE_POLICY` initialization parameter. It applies to the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `MERGE`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` portions of a statement, as well as to the table scan portion. If any parallel restrictions are violated, then the hint is ignored.
  **Note:**   The number of servers that can be used is twice the value in the `PARALLEL` hint, if sorting or grouping operations also take place.
For a **statement-level PARALLEL hint**:
- PARALLEL: The statement results in a degree of parallelism equal to or greater than the computed degree of parallelism, except when parallelism is not feasible for the lowest cost plan. When parallelism is is not feasible, the statement runs serially.
``````
- PARALLEL (DEFAULT): The optimizer calculates a degree of parallelism equal to the number of CPUs available on all participating instances times the value of the PARALLEL_THREADS_PER_CPU initialization parameter.
````
- PARALLEL (AUTO): The statement results in a degree of parallelism that is equal to or greater than the computed degree of parallelism, except when parallelism is not feasible for the lowest cost plan. When parallelism is is not feasible, the statement runs serially.
````
- PARALLEL (MANUAL): The optimizer is forced to use the parallel settings of the objects in the statement.
****
- PARALLEL (integer): The optimizer uses the degree of parallelism specified by integer.
In the following example, the optimizer calculates the degree of parallelism. The statement always runs in parallel.
```
SELECT /*+ PARALLEL */ last_name
  FROM employees;
```
In the following example, the optimizer calculates the degree of parallelism, but that degree may be 1, in which case the statement will run serially.
```
SELECT /*+ PARALLEL (AUTO) */ last_name
  FROM employees;
```
In the following example, the `PARALLEL` hint advises the optimizer to use the degree of parallelism currently in effect for the table itself, which is 5:
```
CREATE TABLE parallel_table (col1 number, col2 VARCHAR2(10)) PARALLEL 5;
SELECT /*+ PARALLEL (MANUAL) */ col2
  FROM parallel_table;
```
For an **object-level PARALLEL hint**:
- PARALLEL: The query coordinator should examine the settings of the initialization parameters to determine the default degree of parallelism.
****
- PARALLEL (integer): The optimizer uses the degree of parallelism specified by integer.
``````
- PARALLEL (DEFAULT): The optimizer calculates a degree of parallelism equal to the number of CPUs available on all participating instances times the value of the PARALLEL_THREADS_PER_CPU initialization parameter.
In the following example, the `PARALLEL` hint overrides the degree of parallelism specified in the `employees` table definition:
```
SELECT /*+ FULL(hr_emp) PARALLEL(hr_emp, 5) */ last_name
  FROM employees hr_emp;
```
In the next example, the `PARALLEL` hint overrides the degree of parallelism specified in the `employees` table definition and instructs the optimizer to calculate a degree of parallelism equal to the number of CPUs available on all participating instances times the value of the `PARALLEL_THREADS_PER_CPU` initialization parameter.
```
SELECT /*+ FULL(hr_emp) PARALLEL(hr_emp, DEFAULT) */ last_name
  FROM employees hr_emp;
```

### PARALLEL_INDEX Hint
Description of the illustration parallel_index_hint.gif
Description of the illustration parallel_index_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, indexspec::=)
The `PARALLEL_INDEX` hint instructs the optimizer to use the specified number of concurrent servers to parallelize index range scans, full scans, and fast full scans for partitioned indexes.
The *integer* value indicates the degree of parallelism for the specified index. Specifying `DEFAULT` or no value signifies that the query coordinator should examine the settings of the initialization parameters to determine the default degree of parallelism. For example, the following hint indicates three parallel execution processes are to be used:
```
SELECT /*+ PARALLEL_INDEX(table1, index1, 3) */
```

### PQ_CONCURRENT_UNION Hint
Description of the illustration pq_concurrent_union_hint.gif
Description of the illustration pq_concurrent_union_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `PQ_CONCURRENT_UNION` hint instructs the optimizer to enable concurrent processing of `UNION` and `UNION` `ALL` operations.

- NO_PQ_CONCURRENT_UNION Hint
**

### PQ_DISTRIBUTE Hint
Description of the illustration pq_distribute_hint.gif
Description of the illustration pq_distribute_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `PQ_DISTRIBUTE` hint instructs the optimizer how to distribute rows among producer and consumer query servers. You can control the distribution of rows for either joins or for load.
**Control of Distribution for Load**
You can control the distribution of rows for parallel `INSERT` … `SELECT` and parallel `CREATE` `TABLE` … `AS` `SELECT` statements to direct how rows should be distributed between the producer (query) and the consumer (load) servers. Use the upper branch of the syntax by specifying a single distribution method. The values of the distribution methods and their semantics are described in Table 2-24.
Table 24 Distribution Values for Load

| Distribution | Description |
|---|---|
| NONE | No distribution. That is the query and load operation are combined into each query server. All servers will load all partitions. This lack of distribution is useful to avoid the overhead of distributing rows where there is no skew. Skew can occur due to empty segments or to a predicate in the statement that filters out all rows evaluated by the query. If skew occurs due to using this method, then use either RANDOM or RANDOM_LOCAL distribution instead.Note: Use this distribution with care. Each partition loaded requires a minimum of 512 KB per process of PGA memory. If you also use compression, then approximately 1.5 MB of PGA memory is consumer per server. |
| PARTITION | This method uses the partitioning information of tablespec to distribute the rows from the query servers to the load servers. Use this distribution method when it is not possible or desirable to combine the query and load operations, when the number of partitions being loaded is greater than or equal to the number of load servers, and the input data will be evenly distributed across the partitions being loaded-that is, there is no skew. |
| RANDOM | This method distributes the rows from the producers in a round-robin fashion to the consumers. Use this distribution method when the input data is highly skewed. |
| RANDOM_LOCAL | This method distributes the rows from the producers to a set of servers that are responsible for maintaining a given set of partitions. Two or more servers can be loading the same partition, but no servers are loading all partitions. Use this distribution method when the input data is skewed and combining query and load operations is not possible due to memory constraints. |

For example, in the following direct-path insert operation, the query and load portions of the operation are combined into each query server:
```
INSERT /*+ APPEND PARALLEL(target_table, 16) PQ_DISTRIBUTE(target_table, NONE) */
  INTO target_table
  SELECT * FROM source_table;
```
In the following table creation example, the optimizer uses the partitioning of target_table to distribute the rows:
```
CREATE /*+ PQ_DISTRIBUTE(target_table, PARTITION) */ TABLE target_table
  NOLOGGING PARALLEL 16
  PARTITION BY HASH (l_orderkey) PARTITIONS 512
  AS SELECT * FROM source_table;
```
**Control of Distribution for Joins**
You control the distribution method for joins by specifying two distribution methods, as shown in the lower branch of the syntax diagram, one distribution for the outer table and one distribution for the inner table.
**
- outer_distribution is the distribution for the outer table.
**
- inner_distribution is the distribution for the inner table.
The values of the distributions are `HASH`, `BROADCAST`, `PARTITION`, and `NONE`. Only six combinations table distributions are valid, as described in Table 2-25:
Table 25 Distribution Values for Joins

| Distribution | Description |
|---|---|
| HASH, HASH | The rows of each table are mapped to consumer query servers, using a hash function on the join keys. When mapping is complete, each query server performs the join between a pair of resulting partitions. This distribution is recommended when the tables are comparable in size and the join operation is implemented by hash-join or sort merge join. |
| BROADCAST, NONE | All rows of the outer table are broadcast to each query server. The inner table rows are randomly partitioned. This distribution is recommended when the outer table is very small compared with the inner table. As a general rule, use this distribution when the inner table size multiplied by the number of query servers is greater than the outer table size. |
| NONE, BROADCAST | All rows of the inner table are broadcast to each consumer query server. The outer table rows are randomly partitioned. This distribution is recommended when the inner table is very small compared with the outer table. As a general rule, use this distribution when the inner table size multiplied by the number of query servers is less than the outer table size. |
| PARTITION, NONE | The rows of the outer table are mapped using the partitioning of the inner table. The inner table must be partitioned on the join keys. This distribution is recommended when the number of partitions of the outer table is equal to or nearly equal to a multiple of the number of query servers; for example, 14 partitions and 15 query servers.Note: The optimizer ignores this hint if the inner table is not partitioned or not equijoined on the partitioning key. |
| NONE, PARTITION | The rows of the inner table are mapped using the partitioning of the outer table. The outer table must be partitioned on the join keys. This distribution is recommended when the number of partitions of the outer table is equal to or nearly equal to a multiple of the number of query servers; for example, 14 partitions and 15 query servers.Note: The optimizer ignores this hint if the outer table is not partitioned or not equijoined on the partitioning key. |
| NONE, NONE | Each query server performs the join operation between a pair of matching partitions, one from each table. Both tables must be equipartitioned on the join keys. |

For example, given two tables `r` and `s` that are joined using a hash join, the following query contains a hint to use hash distribution:
```
SELECT /*+ORDERED PQ_DISTRIBUTE(s HASH, HASH) USE_HASH (s)*/ column_list
  FROM r,s
  WHERE r.c=s.c;
```
To broadcast the outer table `r`, the query is:
```
SELECT /*+ORDERED PQ_DISTRIBUTE(s BROADCAST, NONE) USE_HASH (s) */ column_list
  FROM r,s
  WHERE r.c=s.c;
```
### PQ_FILTER Hint
Description of the illustration pq_filter_hint.gif
Description of the illustration pq_filter_hint.eps
The `PQ_FILTER` hint instructs the optimizer on how to process rows when filtering correlated subqueries.
- SERIAL: Process rows serially on the left and right sides of the filter. Use this option when the overhead of parallelization is too high for the query, for example, when the left side has very few rows.
- NONE: Process rows in parallel on the left and right sides of the filter. Use this option when there is no skew in the distribution of the data on the left side of the filter and you would like to avoid distribution of the left side, for example, due to the large size of the left side.
- HASH: Process rows in parallel on the left side of the filter using a hash distribution. Process rows serially on the right side of the filter. Use this option when there is no skew in the distribution of data on the left side of the filter.
- RANDOM: Process rows in parallel on the left side of the filter using a random distribution. Process rows serially on the right side of the filter. Use this option when there is skew in the distribution of data on the left side of the filter.
### PQ_SKEW Hint
Description of the illustration pq_skew_hint.gif
Description of the illustration pq_skew_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `PQ_SKEW` hint advises the optimizer that the distribution of the values of the join keys for a parallel join is highly skewed-that is, a high percentage of rows have the same join key values. The table specified in *tablespec* is the probe table of the hash join.
### PUSH_PRED Hint
Description of the illustration push_pred_hint.gif
Description of the illustration push_pred_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `PUSH_PRED` hint instructs the optimizer to push a join predicate into the view. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE(v) PUSH_PRED(v) */ *
  FROM employees e,
    (SELECT manager_id
      FROM employees) v
  WHERE e.manager_id = v.manager_id(+)
    AND e.employee_id = 100;
```
### PUSH_SUBQ Hint
Description of the illustration push_subq_hint.gif
Description of the illustration push_subq_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `PUSH_SUBQ` hint instructs the optimizer to evaluate nonmerged subqueries at the earliest possible step in the execution plan. Generally, subqueries that are not merged are executed as the last step in the execution plan. If the subquery is relatively inexpensive and reduces the number of rows significantly, then evaluating the subquery earlier can improve performance.
This hint has no effect if the subquery is applied to a remote table or one that is joined using a merge join.
### PX_JOIN_FILTER Hint
Description of the illustration px_join_filter_hint.gif
Description of the illustration px_join_filter_hint.eps
This hint forces the optimizer to use parallel join bitmap filtering.
### QB_NAME Hint
Description of the illustration qb_name_hint.gif
Description of the illustration qb_name_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
Use the `QB_NAME` hint to define a name for a query block. This name can then be used in a hint in the outer query or even in a hint in an inline view to affect query execution on the tables appearing in the named query block.
If two or more query blocks have the same name, or if the same query block is hinted twice with different names, then the optimizer ignores all the names and the hints referencing that query block. Query blocks that are not named using this hint have unique system-generated names. These names can be displayed in the plan table and can also be used in hints within the query block, or in query block hints. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(qb) FULL(@qb e) */ employee_id, last_name
  FROM employees e
  WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
```
### RESULT_CACHE Hint
Description of the illustration result_cache_hint.eps
**Note:**   Support for the `TEMP` option is only available in ADB (Oracle Autonomous) 19c.
The `RESULT_CACHE` hint instructs the database to cache the results of the current query or query fragment in memory and then to use the cached results in future executions of the query or query fragment. The hint is recognized in the top-level query, the *subquery_factoring_clause*, or `FROM` clause inline view. The cached results reside in the result cache memory portion of the shared pool.
A cached result is automatically invalidated whenever a database object used in its creation is successfully modified. This hint takes precedence over settings of the `RESULT_CACHE_MODE` initialization parameter.
The query is eligible for result caching only if all functions entailed in the query-for example, built-in or user-defined functions or virtual columns-are deterministic.
If the query is executed from OCI client and OCI client result cache is enabled, then `RESULT_CACHE` hint enables client caching for the current query.
**TEMP = TRUE | FALSE**
**Note:**   Support for the `TEMP` option is only available in ADB (Oracle Autonomous) 19c.
If `TEMP` has a value of `TRUE` , then the query will be allowed to spill to disk and allocate space in the temporary tablespace, if needed.
If `TEMP` has a value of `FALSE` , then the query will not be allowed to spill to disk and use the temporary tablespace for caching the result.
Both values `TRUE` and `FALSE` override the value of the `RESULT_CACHE_MODE` initialization parameter.
If you do not specify `TEMP`, then the value of `RESULT_CACHE_MODE` holds.
**SHELFLIFE**
Use `SHELFLIFE` to specify how long (in seconds) the result of a query or a query fragment should be cached in memory.
`SHELFLIFE` has two purposes:
- It specifies how long results will be cached for objects where the database has no knowledge about when to invalidate. These are results based on objects like fixed objects, objects accessed via DB or Cloud Links, or Data Link objects.
- It specifies how long results will be cached for local objects. Without SHELFLIFE, results on local objects are cached until they are aged out of the result cache. With this object you can define when a result will be automatically invalidated even if no DML happened on the objects.
The `SHELFLIFE` value must be a positive integer. The maximum value is 4294967295 seconds.
**Example: RESULT_CACHE with SHELFLIFE**
The following example shows a `RESULT_CACHE` hint with a value of `120` for`SHELFLIFE`. This means that the result of the query or query fragment in which this hint appears will be cached for 120 seconds.
```
/*+ RESULT_CACHE (SHELFLIFE=120) */
```
After 120 seconds, the cached result is marked as invalid.
If the query result is large and does not fit in memory, use both the `SHELFLIFE` and the `TEMP` options to indicate that the result should be written to disk in the temporary tablespace.
**Example: RESULT_CACHE with TEMP and SHELFLIFE**
```
/*+ RESULT_CACHE ( TEMP= true SHELFLIFE=120) */
```
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* for information about using this hint, *Oracle Database Reference* for information about the `RESULT_CACHE_MODE` initialization parameter, and *Oracle Call Interface Programmer’s Guide* for more information about the OCI result cache and usage guidelines
### RETRY_ON_ROW_CHANGE Hint
Description of the illustration retry_on_row_change.gif
Description of the illustration retry_on_row_change.eps
**Note:**   The `CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX`, `IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX`, and `RETRY_ON_ROW_CHANGE` hints are unlike other hints in that they have a semantic effect. The general philosophy explained in Hints does not apply for these three hints.
This hint is valid only for `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations. It is not supported for `INSERT` or `MERGE` operations. When you specify this hint, the operation is retried when the `ORA_ROWSCN` for one or more rows in the set has changed from the time the set of rows to be modified is determined to the time the block is actually modified.
**See Also:**   IGNORE_ROW_ON_DUPKEY_INDEX Hint and CHANGE_DUPKEY_ERROR_INDEX Hint
### REWRITE Hint
Description of the illustration rewrite_hint.gif
Description of the illustration rewrite_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `REWRITE` hint instructs the optimizer to rewrite a query in terms of materialized views, when possible, without cost consideration. Use the `REWRITE` hint with or without a view list. If you use `REWRITE` with a view list and the list contains an eligible materialized view, then Oracle uses that view regardless of its cost.
Oracle does not consider views outside of the list. If you do not specify a view list, then Oracle searches for an eligible materialized view and always uses it regardless of the cost of the final plan.

### STAR_TRANSFORMATION Hint
Description of the illustration star_transformation_hint.gif
Description of the illustration star_transformation_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `STAR_TRANSFORMATION` hint instructs the optimizer to use the best plan in which the transformation has been used. Without the hint, the optimizer could make a query optimization decision to use the best plan generated without the transformation, instead of the best plan for the transformed query. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ STAR_TRANSFORMATION */ s.time_id, s.prod_id, s.channel_id
  FROM sales s, times t, products p, channels c
  WHERE s.time_id = t.time_id
    AND s.prod_id = p.prod_id
    AND s.channel_id = c.channel_id
    AND c.channel_desc = 'Tele Sales';
```
Even if the hint is specified, there is no guarantee that the transformation will take place. The optimizer generates the subqueries only if it seems reasonable to do so. If no subqueries are generated, then there is no transformed query, and the best plan for the untransformed query is used, regardless of the hint.

### STATEMENT_QUEUING Hint
Description of the illustration statement_queuing_hint.gif
Description of the illustration statement_queuing_hint.eps
The `NO_STATEMENT_QUEUING` hint influences whether or not a statement is queued with parallel statement queuing.
When `PARALLEL_DEGREE_POLICY` is not set to `AUTO`, this hint enables a statement to be considered for parallel statement queuing, but to run only when enough parallel processes are available to run at the requested DOP. The number of available parallel execution servers, before queuing is enabled, is equal to the difference between the number of parallel execution servers in use and the maximum number allowed in the system, which is defined by the `PARALLEL_SERVERS_TARGET` initialization parameter.
For example:
```
SELECT /*+ STATEMENT_QUEUING */ emp.last_name, dpt.department_name
  FROM employees emp, departments dpt
  WHERE emp.department_id = dpt.department_id;
```

### UNNEST Hint

Description of the illustration unnest_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `UNNEST` hint instructs the optimizer to unnest and merge the body of the subquery into the body of the query block that contains it, allowing the optimizer to consider them together when evaluating access paths and joins.
Before a subquery is unnested, the optimizer first verifies whether the statement is valid. The statement must then pass heuristic and query optimization tests. The `UNNEST` hint instructs the optimizer to check the subquery block for validity only. If the subquery block is valid, then subquery unnesting is enabled without checking the heuristics or costs.

### USE_BAND Hint
Description of the illustration use_band_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `USE_BAND` hint instructs the optimizer to join each specified table with another row source using a band join. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ USE_BAND(e1 e2) */
  e1.last_name

  || ' has salary between 100 less and 100 more than '
  || e2.last_name AS "SALARY COMPARISON"

FROM employees e1, employees e2
WHERE e1.salary BETWEEN e2.salary - 100 AND e2.salary + 100;
```
The order the tables are listed in the `USE_BAND` hint does not specify a join order. To hint a specific join order, the `LEADING` hint is required.
### USE_CONCAT Hint
Description of the illustration use_concat_hint.gif
Description of the illustration use_concat_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint)
The `USE_CONCAT` hint instructs the optimizer to transform combined `OR`-conditions in the `WHERE` clause of a query into a compound query using the `UNION` `ALL` set operator. Without this hint, this transformation occurs only if the cost of the query using the concatenations is cheaper than the cost without them. The `USE_CONCAT` hint overrides the cost consideration. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ USE_CONCAT */ *
  FROM employees e
  WHERE manager_id = 108
     OR department_id = 110;
```
**See Also:**   The NO_EXPAND Hint, which is the opposite of this hint
### USE_CUBE Hint
Description of the illustration use_cube_hint.gif
Description of the illustration use_cube_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
When the right-hand side of the join is a cube, the `USE_CUBE` hint instructs the optimizer to join each specified table with another row source using a cube join. If the optimizer decides not to use the cube join based on statistical analysis, then you can use `USE_CUBE` to override that decision.
### USE_HASH Hint
Description of the illustration use_hash_hint.gif
Description of the illustration use_hash_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `USE_HASH` hint instructs the optimizer to join each specified table with another row source using a hash join. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ USE_HASH(l h) */ *
  FROM orders h, order_items l
  WHERE l.order_id = h.order_id
    AND l.order_id > 2400;
```
The order the tables are listed in the `USE_HASH` hint does not specify a join order. To hint a specific join order, the `LEADING` hint is required.
### USE_MERGE Hint
Description of the illustration use_merge_hint.gif
Description of the illustration use_merge_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
The `USE_MERGE` hint instructs the optimizer to join each specified table with another row source using a sort-merge join. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ USE_MERGE(employees departments) */ *
  FROM employees, departments
  WHERE employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
Use of the `USE_NL` and `USE_MERGE` hints is recommended with the `LEADING` and `ORDERED` hints. The optimizer uses those hints when the referenced table is forced to be the inner table of a join. The hints are ignored if the referenced table is the outer table.
### USE_NL Hint
The `USE_NL` hint instructs the optimizer to join each specified table to another row source with a nested loops join, using the specified table as the inner table.
Description of the illustration use_nl_hint.gif
Description of the illustration use_nl_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*)
Use of the `USE_NL` and `USE_MERGE` hints is recommended with the `LEADING` and `ORDERED` hints. The optimizer uses those hints when the referenced table is forced to be the inner table of a join. The hints are ignored if the referenced table is the outer table.
In the following example, where a nested loop is forced through a hint, `orders` is accessed through a full table scan and the filter condition `l.order_id = h.order_id` is applied to every row. For every row that meets the filter condition, `order_items` is accessed through the index `order_id`.
```
SELECT /*+ USE_NL(l h) */ h.customer_id, l.unit_price * l.quantity
  FROM orders h, order_items l
  WHERE l.order_id = h.order_id;
```
The order the tables are listed in the `USE_NL` hint does not specify a join order. To hint a specific join order, the `LEADING` hint is required.
**Example**
```
select /*+ LEADING(t2) USE_NL(t1) */ sum(t1.a),sum(t2.a)
from   t1 , t2
where   t1.b = t2.b;
select * from table(dbms_xplan.display_cursor()) ;
```
Adding an `INDEX` hint to the query could avoid the full table scan on `orders`, resulting in an execution plan similar to one used on larger systems, even though it might not be particularly efficient here.
### USE_NL_WITH_INDEX Hint
Description of the illustration use_nl_with_index_hint.gif
Description of the illustration use_nl_with_index_hint.eps
(See Specifying a Query Block in a Hint, *tablespec::=*, *indexspec::=*)
The `USE_NL_WITH_INDEX` hint instructs the optimizer to join the specified table to another row source with a nested loops join using the specified table as the inner table. For example:
```
SELECT /*+ USE_NL_WITH_INDEX(l item_product_ix) */ *
  FROM orders h, order_items l
  WHERE l.order_id = h.order_id
    AND l.order_id > 2400;
```
The following conditions apply:
- If no index is specified, then the optimizer must be able to use some index with at least one join predicate as the index key.
- If an index is specified, then the optimizer must be able to use that index with at least one join predicate as the index key.
