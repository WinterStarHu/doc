## Purpose
The `LENGTH` functions return the length of *char*. `LENGTH` calculates length using characters as defined by the input character set. `LENGTHB` uses bytes instead of characters. `LENGTHC` uses Unicode complete characters. `LENGTH2` uses UCS2 code points. `LENGTH4` uses UCS4 code points.
*char* can be any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, or `NCLOB`. The exceptions are `LENGTHC`, `LENGTH2`, and `LENGTH4`, which do not allow *char* to be a `CLOB` or `NCLOB`. The return value is of data type `NUMBER`. If *char* has data type `CHAR`, then the length includes all trailing blanks. If *char* is null, then this function returns null.

## Restriction on LENGTHB
The `LENGTHB` function is supported for single-byte LOBs only. It cannot be used with `CLOB` and `NCLOB` data in a multibyte character set.
## Examples
The following example uses the `LENGTH` function using a single-byte database character set:
```
SELECT LENGTH('CANDIDE') "Length in characters"
  FROM DUAL;
Length in characters
--------------------
                   7
```
The next example assumes a double-byte database character set.
```
SELECT LENGTHB ('CANDIDE') "Length in bytes"
  FROM DUAL;
Length in bytes
---------------
             14
```
