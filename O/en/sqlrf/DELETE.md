# DELETE

## Purpose
Use the `DELETE` statement to remove rows from:
- An unpartitioned or partitioned table
- The unpartitioned or partitioned base table of a view
- The unpartitioned or partitioned container table of a writable materialized view
- The unpartitioned or partitioned master table of an updatable materialized view
## Prerequisites
For you to delete rows from a table, the table must be in your own schema or you must have the `DELETE` object privilege on the table.
For you to delete rows from an updatable materialized view, the materialized view must be in your own schema or you must have the `DELETE` object privilege on the materialized view.
For you to delete rows from the base table of a view, the owner of the schema containing the view must have the `DELETE` object privilege on the base table. Also, if the view is in a schema other than your own, then you must have the `DELETE` object privilege on the view.
The `DELETE` `ANY` `TABLE` system privilege also allows you to delete rows from any table or table partition or from the base table of any view.
To delete rows from an object on a remote database, you must also have the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege on the object.
To specify the *returning_clause*, you must have the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege on the object.
If the `SQL92_SECURITY` initialization parameter is set to `TRUE` and the `DELETE` operation references table columns, such as the columns in a *where_clause* or*returning_clause* , then you must have the `SELECT` object privilege on the object from which you want to delete rows.
You cannot delete rows from a table if a function-based index on the table has become invalid. You must first validate the function-based index.

## Semantics
## *hint*
Specify a comment that passes instructions to the optimizer on choosing an execution plan for the statement.
**See Also:**   “Hints” for the syntax and description of hints
## *from_clause*
Use the `FROM` clause to specify the database objects from which you are deleting rows.
The `ONLY` syntax is relevant only for views. Use the `ONLY` clause if the view in the `FROM` clause belongs to a view hierarchy and you do not want to delete rows from any of its subviews.
## *DML_table_expression_clause*
Use this clause to specify the objects from which data is being deleted.
## *schema*
Specify the schema containing the table or view. If you omit *schema*, then Oracle Database assumes the table or view is in your own schema.
## *table*|*view*|*materialized view*|*subquery*
Specify the name of a table, view, materialized view, or the column or columns resulting from a subquery, from which the rows are to be deleted.
When you delete rows from an updatable view, Oracle Database deletes rows from the base table.
You cannot delete rows from a read-only materialized view. If you delete rows from a writable materialized view, then the database removes the rows from the underlying container table. However, the deletions are overwritten at the next refresh operation. If you delete rows from an updatable materialized view that is part of a materialized view group, then the database also removes the corresponding rows from the master table.
If *table* or the base table of *view* or the master table of *materialized_view* contains one or more domain index columns, then this statement executes the appropriate indextype delete routine.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Data Cartridge Developer’s Guide* for more information on these routines
Issuing a `DELETE` statement against a table fires any `DELETE` triggers defined on the table.
All table or index space released by the deleted rows is retained by the table and index.
## *partition_extension_clause*
Specify the name or partition key value of the partition or subpartition targeted for deletes within the object.
You need not specify the partition name when deleting values from a partitioned object. However, in some cases, specifying the partition name is more efficient than a complicated *where_clause*.
**See Also:**   “References to Partitioned Tables and Indexes” and “Deleting Rows from a Partition: Example”
## *dblink*
Specify the complete or partial name of a database link to a remote database where the object is located. You can delete rows from a remote object only if you are using Oracle Database distributed functionality.
**Note:**   Starting with Oracle Database 12*c* Release 2 (12.2), the `DELETE` statement accepts remote LOB locators as bind variables. Refer to the “Distributed LOBs” chapter in *Oracle Database SecureFiles and Large Objects Developer’s Guide* for more information.
**See Also:**   “References to Objects in Remote Databases” for information on referring to database links and “Deleting Rows from a Remote Database: Example”
If you omit *dblink*, then the database assumes that the object is located on the local database.
## *subquery_restriction_clause*
The *subquery_restriction_clause* lets you restrict the subquery in one of the following ways:
**WITH READ ONLY**
Specify `WITH READ ONLY` to indicate that the table or view cannot be updated.
**WITH CHECK OPTION**
Specify `WITH CHECK OPTION` to indicate that Oracle Database prohibits any changes to the table or view that would produce rows that are not included in the subquery. When used in the subquery of a DML statement, you can specify this clause in a subquery in the `FROM` clause but not in subquery in the `WHERE` clause.
**CONSTRAINT** *constraint*
Specify the name of the `CHECK OPTION` constraint. If you omit this identifier, then Oracle automatically assigns the constraint a name of the form `SYS_C`*n*, where n is an integer that makes the constraint name unique within the database.
**See Also:**   “Using the WITH CHECK OPTION Clause: Example”
## *table_collection_expression*
The *table_collection_expression* lets you inform Oracle that the value of *collection_expression* should be treated as a table for purposes of query and DML operations. The *collection_expression* can be a subquery, a column, a function, or a collection constructor. Regardless of its form, it must return a collection value-that is, a value whose type is nested table or varray. This process of extracting the elements of a collection is called **collection unnesting**.
The optional plus (+) is relevant if you are joining the `TABLE` collection expression with the parent table. The + creates an outer join of the two, so that the query returns rows from the outer table even if the collection expression is null.
**Note:**   In earlier releases of Oracle, when *collection_expression* was a subquery, *table_collection_expression* was expressed as `THE` *subquery*. That usage is now deprecated.
You can use a *table_collection_expression* in a correlated subquery to delete rows with values that also exist in another table.
**See Also:**   “Table Collections: Examples”
## *collection_expression*
Specify a subquery that selects a nested table column from the object from which you are deleting.
**Restrictions on the** ***dml_table_expression_clause*** **Clause**
This clause is subject to the following restrictions:
******````
- You cannot execute this statement if table or the base or master table of view or materialized_view contains any domain indexes marked IN_PROGRESS or FAILED.
- You cannot insert into a partition if any affected index partitions are marked UNUSABLE.
````**
- You cannot specify the ORDER BY clause in the subquery of the DML_table_expression_clause.
````
  - A set operator
  - A DISTINCT operator
  - An aggregate or analytic function
``````````````````
  - A GROUP BY, ORDER BY, MODEL, CONNECT BY, or START WITH clause
  - A collection expression in a SELECT list
  - A subquery in a SELECT list
  - A subquery designated WITH READ ONLY
**
  - Joins, with some exceptions, as documented in Oracle Database Administrator’s Guide
If you specify an index, index partition, or index subpartition that has been marked `UNUSABLE`, then the `DELETE` statement will fail unless the `SKIP_UNUSABLE_INDEXES` initialization parameter has been set to `true`.
**See Also:**   ALTER SESSION
## *t_alias*
Provide a **correlation name** for the table, view, materialized view, subquery, or collection value to be referenced elsewhere in the statement. This alias is required if the *DML_table_expression_clause* references any object type attributes or object type methods. Table aliases are generally used in `DELETE` statements with correlated queries.
## *where_clause*
Use the *where_clause* to delete only rows that satisfy the condition. The condition can reference the object from which you are deleting and can contain a subquery. You can delete rows from a remote object only if you are using Oracle Database distributed functionality. Refer to Conditions for the syntax of *condition*.
If this clause contains a *subquery* that refers to remote objects, then the `DELETE` operation can run in parallel as long as the reference does not loop back to an object on the local database. However, if the *subquery* in the *DML_table_expression_clause* refers to any remote objects, then the `DELETE` operation will run serially without notification. Refer to the *parallel_clause* in the `CREATE` `TABLE` documentation for additional information.
If you omit *dblink*, then the database assumes that the table or view is located on the local database.
If you omit the *where_clause*, then the database deletes all rows of the object.
## *returning_clause*
This clause lets you return values from deleted columns, and thereby eliminate the need to issue a `SELECT` statement following the `DELETE` statement.
The returning clause retrieves the rows affected by a DML statement. You can specify this clause for tables and materialized views and for views with a single base table.
When operating on a single row, a DML statement with a *returning_clause* can retrieve column expressions using the affected row, rowid, and `REFs` to the affected row and store them in host variables or PL/SQL variables.
When operating on multiple rows, a DML statement with the *returning_clause* stores values from expressions, rowids, and `REFs` involving the affected rows in bind arrays.
***expr***
Each item in the *expr* list must be a valid expression syntax.
**INTO**
The `INTO` clause indicates that the values of the changed rows are to be stored in the variable(s) specified in *data_item* list.
***data_item***
Each *data_item* is a host variable or PL/SQL variable that stores the retrieved *expr* value.
For each expression in the `RETURNING` list, you must specify a corresponding type-compatible PL/SQL variable or host variable in the `INTO` list.
**Restrictions on the RETURNING Clause**
The following restrictions apply to the `RETURNING` clause:
**
````******````
  - For UPDATE and DELETE statements each expr must be a simple expression or a single-set aggregate function expression. You cannot combine simple expressions and single-set aggregate function expressions in the same returning_clause. For INSERT statements, each expr must be a simple expression. Aggregate functions are not supported in an INSERT statement RETURNING clause.
  - Single-set aggregate function expressions cannot include the DISTINCT keyword.
**````````
- If the expr list contains a primary key column or other NOT NULL column, then the update statement fails if the table has a BEFORE UPDATE trigger defined on it.
**
- You cannot specify the returning_clause for a multitable insert.
- You cannot use this clause with parallel DML or with remote objects.
- You cannot retrieve LONG types with this clause.
````

</div>
```
- You cannot specify this clause for a view on which an INSTEAD OF trigger has been defined. <div class="infoboxnote" markdown="1">
## *error_logging_clause*
The *error_logging_clause* has the same behavior in `DELETE` statement as it does in an `INSERT` statement. Refer to the `INSERT` statement *error_logging_clause* for more information.
**See Also:**   “Inserting Into a Table with Error Logging: Example”
## Examples
**Deleting Rows: Examples**
The following statement deletes all rows from the sample table `oe.product_descriptions` where the value of the `language_id` column is `AR`:
```
DELETE FROM product_descriptions
   WHERE language_id = 'AR';
```
The following statement deletes from the sample table `hr.employees` purchasing clerks whose commission rate is less than 10%:
```
DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP'
   AND commission_pct < .2;
```
The following statement has the same effect as the preceding example, but uses a subquery:
```
DELETE FROM (SELECT * FROM employees)
   WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP'
   AND commission_pct < .2;
```
**Deleting Rows from a Remote Database: Example**
The following statement deletes specified rows from the `locations` table owned by the user `hr` on a database accessible by the database link `remote`:
```
DELETE FROM hr.locations@remote
   WHERE location_id > 3000;
```
**Deleting Nested Table Rows: Example**
For an example that deletes nested table rows, refer to “Table Collections: Examples”.
**Deleting Rows from a Partition: Example**
The following example removes rows from partition `sales_q1_1998` of the `sh.sales` table:
```
DELETE FROM sales PARTITION (sales_q1_1998)
   WHERE amount_sold > 1000;
```
**Using the RETURNING Clause: Example**
The following example returns column `salary` from the deleted rows and stores the result in bind variable `:bnd1`. The bind variable must already have been declared.
```
DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP'
   AND hire_date + TO_YMINTERVAL('01-00') < SYSDATE
   RETURNING salary INTO :bnd1;
```
**Deleting Data from a Table: Example**
The following statements create a table named product_price_history and insert data into it:
```
CREATE TABLE product_price_history (
  product_id          INTEGER NOT NULL,
  price               INTEGER NOT NULL,
  currency_code       VARCHAR2(3 CHAR) NOT NULL,
  effective_from_date DATE NOT NULL,
  effective_to_date   DATE,
  CONSTRAINT product_price_history_pk
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id, currency_code, effective_from_date)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (effective_from_date) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES less than (DATE'2015-01-02'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES less than (DATE'2015-01-03'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES less than (DATE'2015-01-04')
);
INSERT INTO product_price_history
  WITH prices AS (
    SELECT 1, 100, 'USD', DATE'2015-01-01', DATE'2015-01-02'
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 60, 'GBP', DATE'2015-01-01', DATE'2015-01-02'
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 110, 'EUR', DATE'2015-01-01', DATE'2015-01-02'
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 101, 'USD', DATE'2015-01-02', DATE'2015-01-03'
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 62, 'GBP', DATE'2015-01-02', DATE'2015-01-03'
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 109, 'EUR', DATE'2015-01-02', DATE'2015-01-03'
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 105, 'USD', DATE'2015-01-03', NULL
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 61, 'GBP', DATE'2015-01-03', NULL
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 107, 'EUR', DATE'2015-01-03', NULL
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 30, 'USD', DATE'2015-01-01', DATE'2015-01-03'
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 33, 'USD', DATE'2015-01-03', NULL
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 100, 'GBP', DATE'2015-01-03', NULL
    FROM   dual
  )
SELECT *
FROM   prices;
```
The following statement deletes the rows from the table product_price_history where product_id is 3:
```
DELETE FROM product_price_history WHERE product_id = 3;
```
The following procedure deletes the rows from the product_price_history where product_id is 2 and effective_to_date is NULL:
```
DECLARE
  currency product_price_history.currency_code%TYPE;
BEGIN
  DELETE product_price_history
  WHERE  product_id = 2
  AND    effective_to_date IS NULL
  returning currency_code INTO currency;
  dbms_output.Put_line(currency);
END;
USD
```
The following statement deletes the rows from the table product_price_history where currency_code is ‘EUR’:
```
DELETE (SELECT * FROM product_price_history) WHERE  currency_code = 'EUR';
```
The following statement uses a subquery to delete rows from product_price_history:
```
DELETE product_price_history pp
WHERE  (product_id, currency_code, effective_from_date)
   IN (SELECT product_id, currency_code, Max(effective_from_date)
       FROM   product_price_history
       GROUP BY product_id, currency_code);
```
The following statement uses partitions to delete rows from product_price_history:
```
DELETE product_price_history partition (p1);
```
The following statement displays the table information:
```
SELECT * FROM product_price_history;
PRODUCT_ID	PRICE CUR EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVE
---------- ---------- --- --------- ---------
	 1	  100 USD 01-JAN-15 02-JAN-15
	 1	   60 GBP 01-JAN-15 02-JAN-15
```
The following statement deletes all rows from product_price_history:
```
DELETE product_price_history;
```
