## Purpose
`COUNT` returns the number of rows returned by the query. You can use it as an aggregate or analytic function.
If you specify `DISTINCT`, then you can specify only the *query_partition_clause* of the *analytic_clause*. The *order_by_clause* and *windowing_clause* are not allowed.
If you specify *expr*, then `COUNT` returns the number of rows where *expr* is not null. You can count either all rows, or only distinct values of *expr*.
If you specify the asterisk (*), then this function returns all rows, including duplicates and nulls. `COUNT` never returns null.
**Note:**
Before performing a `COUNT` `(DISTINCT` *expr*`)`operation on a large amount of data, consider using one of the following methods to obtain approximate results more quickly than exact results:
``````****
- Set the APPROX_FOR_COUNT_DISTINCT initialization parameter to true before using the COUNT (DISTINCT expr) function. Refer to Oracle Database Reference for more information on this parameter.
``````**
- Use the APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT function instead of the COUNT (DISTINCT expr) function. Refer to APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT.
**See Also:**

- “About SQL Expressions” for information on valid forms of expr and Aggregate Functions

- in Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide for the collation determination rules, which define the collation COUNT uses to compare character values for the DISTINCT clause
## Aggregate Examples
The following examples use `COUNT` as an aggregate function:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) "Total"
  FROM employees;
     Total
----------
       107
SELECT COUNT(*) "Allstars"
  FROM employees
  WHERE commission_pct > 0;
 Allstars
---------
       35
SELECT COUNT(commission_pct) "Count"
  FROM employees;
     Count
----------
        35
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT manager_id) "Managers"
  FROM employees;
  Managers
----------
        18
```
## Analytic Example
The following example calculates, for each employee in the `employees` table, the moving count of employees earning salaries in the range 50 less than through 150 greater than the employee’s salary.
```
SELECT last_name, salary,
       COUNT(*) OVER (ORDER BY salary RANGE BETWEEN 50 PRECEDING AND
                      150 FOLLOWING) AS mov_count
  FROM employees
  ORDER BY salary, last_name;
LAST_NAME                     SALARY  MOV_COUNT
------------------------- ---------- ----------
Olson                           2100          3
Markle                          2200          2
Philtanker                      2200          2
Gee                             2400          8
Landry                          2400          8
Colmenares                      2500         10
Marlow                          2500         10
Patel                           2500         10
. . .
```
