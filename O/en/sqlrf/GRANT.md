# GRANT

## Purpose
Use the `GRANT` statement to grant:
``````
- System privileges to users and roles.Table 18-1 lists the system privileges (organized by the database object operated upon). Note that ANY system privileges, for example, SELECT ANY TABLE, will not work on SYS objects or other dictionary objects.
**
- Roles to users, roles, and program units. The granted roles can be either user-defined (local or external) or predefined. For a list of predefined roles, refer to Oracle Database Security Guide.
****``````
- Object privileges for a particular object to users and roles.Table 18-2 lists the object privileges (organized by the database object operated upon). Note: Global roles (created with IDENTIFIED GLOBALLY) are granted through enterprise roles and cannot be granted using the GRANT statement.
Notes on Authorizing Database Users
You can authorize database users through means other than the database and the `GRANT` statement.
- Many Oracle Database privileges are granted through supplied PL/SQL and Java packages. For information on those privileges, refer to the documentation for the appropriate package.
``````
- Some operating systems have facilities that let you grant roles to Oracle Database users with the initialization parameter OS_ROLES. If you choose to grant roles to users through operating system facilities, then you cannot also grant roles to users with the GRANT statement, although you can use the GRANT statement to grant system privileges to users and system privileges and roles to other roles.
**Note on Oracle Automatic Storage Management**
A user authenticated `AS` `SYSASM` can use this statement to grant the system privileges `SYSASM`, `SYSOPER`, and `SYSDBA` to a user in the Oracle ASM password file of the current node.
**Note on Editionable Objects**
A `GRANT` operation to grant object privileges on an editionable object actualizes the object in the current edition. See *Oracle Database Development Guide* for more information about editions and editionable objects.

## Prerequisites
To grant a **system privilege**, one of the following conditions must be met:
``````
- You must have been granted the GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE system privilege. In this case, if you grant the system privilege to a role, then a user to whom the role has been granted does not have the privilege unless the role is enabled in user’s session.
````
- You must have been granted the system privilege with the ADMIN OPTION. In this case, if you grant the system privilege to a role, then a user to whom the role has been granted has the privilege regardless whether the role is enabled in the user’s session.
To grant a **role to a user or another role**, you must have been directly granted the role with the `ADMIN` `OPTION`, or you must have been granted the `GRANT` `ANY` `ROLE` system privilege, or you must have created the role.
To grant a **role to a program unit in your own schema**, you must have been directly granted the role with either the `ADMIN` `OPTION` or the `DELEGATE` `OPTION`, or you must have been granted the `GRANT` `ANY` `ROLE` system privilege, or you must have created the role.
To grant a **role to a program unit in another user’s schema**, you must be the user `SYS` and the role must have been created by the schema owner or directly granted to the schema owner.
To grant an **object privilege on a user**, by specifying the `ON` `USER` clause of the *on_object_clause*, you must be the user on whom the privilege is granted, or you must have been granted the object privilege on that user with the `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION`, or you must have been granted the `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE` system privilege. If you can grant an object privilege on a user only because you have the `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE`, then the `GRANTOR` column of the `*_TAB_PRIVS` views displays the user on whom the privilege is granted rather than the user who issued the `GRANT` statement.
To grant an **object privilege on all other types of objects**, you must own the object, or the owner of the object must have granted you the object privileges with the `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION`, or you must have been granted the `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE` system privilege. If you have the `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE`, then you can grant the object privilege only if the object owner could have granted the same object privilege. In this case, the `GRANTOR` column of the `*_TAB_PRIVS` views displays the object owner rather than the user who issued the `GRANT` statement.
To specify the `CONTAINER` clause, you must be connected to a multitenant container database (CDB). To specify `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL`, the current container must be the root.

## Semantics
## *grant_system_privileges*
Use these clauses to grant system privileges.
***system_privilege***
Specify the system privilege you want to grant. Table 18-1 lists the system privileges, organized by the database object operated upon.
****
- If you grant a privilege to a user, then the database adds the privilege to the user’s privilege domain. The user can immediately exercise the privilege. Oracle recommends that you only grant the ANY privileges to trusted users.
****
****
- If you grant a privilege to a role, then the database adds the privilege to the privilege domain of the role. Users who have been granted and have enabled the role can immediately exercise the privilege. Other users who have been granted the role can enable the role and exercise the privilege. See Also: Granting a System Privilege to a User: Example and “Granting System Privileges to a Role: Example”
****
- If you grant a privilege to PUBLIC, then the database adds the privilege to the privilege domains of each user. All users can immediately perform operations authorized by the privilege. Oracle recommends against granting system privileges to PUBLIC.
***role***
Specify the role you want to grant. You can grant an Oracle Database predefined role or a user-defined role.
****
````**
- If you grant a role to a user, then the database makes the role available to the user. The user can immediately enable the role and exercise the privileges in the privilege domain of the role. In the case of a secure application role, you need not grant such a role directly to the user. You can let the associated PL/SQL package do this, assuming the user passes appropriate security policies. For more information, see the CREATE ROLE semantics for USING package and Oracle Database Security Guide
****
- If you grant a role to another role, then the database adds the privilege domain of the granted role to the privilege domain of the grantee role. Users who have been granted the grantee role can enable it and exercise the privileges in the granted role’s privilege domain.
****
****``````
- If you grant a role to PUBLIC, then the database makes the role available to all users. All users can immediately enable the role and exercise the privileges in the privilege domain of the role. Note: Unlimited tablespace is not granted to the DBA role, but when a grant is executed to grant DBA to a user, unlimited tablespace is granted as part of the same grant, provided the user executing the GRANT command has unlimited tablespace granted with the ADMIN or GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE system privilege .
**ALL PRIVILEGES**
Specify `ALL` `PRIVILEGES` to grant all of the system privileges listed in Table 18-1, except the `SELECT` `ANY` `DICTIONARY`, `ALTER` `DATABASE` `LINK`, and `ALTER` `PUBLIC` `DATABASE` `LINK` privileges.
However, grant and revoke `ALL PRIVILEGES` do not apply to `ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT`. Granting `ALL PRIVILEGES` does not grant `ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT`. Similarly, revoking `ALL PRIVILEGES` does not revoke `ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT`.
```

  </div>
```
***grantee_clause***
Use the *grantee_clause* to specify the users or roles to which the system privilege, role, or object privilege is granted.
**PUBLIC**
Specify `PUBLIC` to grant the privileges to all users. Oracle recommends against granting system privileges to `PUBLIC`.
**Restriction on Grantees**
A user, role, or `PUBLIC` cannot appear more than once in the *grantee_clause.*
***grantee_identified_by***
The *grantee_identified_by* clause lets you assign passwords to users when granting them system privileges and roles. You must specify an equal number of users and passwords. The first password is assigned to the first user, the second password is assigned to the second user, and so on. If a specified user exists, then the database resets the user’s password. If a specified user does not exist, then the database creates the user with the password.
**See Also:**   CREATE USER for restrictions on usernames and passwords and “Assigning User Passwords When Granting a System Privilege: Example”
**WITH ADMIN OPTION**
Specify `WITH` `ADMIN` `OPTION` to enable the grantee to:
- Grant the privilege or role to another user or role, unless the role is a GLOBAL role
- Revoke the privilege or role from another user or role
- Alter the privilege or role to change the authorization needed to access it
- Drop the privilege or role
- Grant the role to a program unit in the grantee’s schema.
- Revoke the role from a program unit in the grantee’s schema.
If you grant a system privilege or role to a user without specifying `WITH` `ADMIN` `OPTION`, and then subsequently grant the privilege or role to the user `WITH` `ADMIN` `OPTION`, then the user has the `ADMIN` `OPTION` on the privilege or role.
To revoke the `ADMIN` `OPTION` on a system privilege or role from a user, you must revoke the privilege or role from the user altogether and then grant the privilege or role to the user without the `ADMIN` `OPTION`.
**See Also:**   “Granting a Role with the ADMIN OPTION: Example”
**WITH DELEGATE OPTION**
You can specify this clause only when granting a role to a user.
Specify `WITH` `DELEGATE` `OPTION` to enable the grantee to:
- Grant the role to a program unit in the grantee’s schema
- Revoke the role from a program unit in the grantee’s schema
If you grant a role to a user without specifying `WITH` `DELEGATE` `OPTION`, and then subsequently grant the role to the user `WITH` `DELEGATE` `OPTION`, then the user has the `DELEGATE` `OPTION` on the role.
To revoke the `DELEGATE` `OPTION` on a role from a user, you must revoke the role from the user altogether and then grant the role to the user without the `DELEGATE` `OPTION`.
**See Also:**
- “Granting a Role with the DELEGATE OPTION: Example”
**
- The grant_roles_to_programs clause for more information on granting roles to program units
**Restrictions on Granting System Privileges and Roles**
Privileges and roles are subject to the following restrictions:
- A privilege or role cannot appear more than once in the list of privileges and roles to be granted.
- You cannot grant a role to itself.
````
- You cannot grant a role IDENTIFIED GLOBALLY to anything.
````
- You cannot grant a role IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY to a global user or global role.
````````
- You cannot grant roles circularly. For example, if you grant the role banker to the role teller, then you cannot subsequently grant teller to banker.
````````````
- You cannot grant an IDENTIFIED BY role, IDENTIFIED USING role, or IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY role to another role.
## *grant_object_privileges*
Use these clauses to grant object privileges.
***object_privilege***
Specify the object privilege you want to grant. Table 18-2 lists the object privileges, organized by the type of object on which they can be granted. When you grant an object privilege on a editionable object, either to a user or to a role, the object is actualized in the edition in which the grant is made. Refer to CREATE EDITION for information on editionable object types and editions.
**Note:**
To grant `SELECT` on a view to another user, either you must own all of the objects underlying the view or you must have been granted the `SELECT` object privilege `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION` on all of those underlying objects. This is true even if the grantee already has `SELECT` privileges on those underlying objects.
To grant `READ` on a view to another user, either you must own all of the objects underlying the view or you must have been granted the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION` on all of those underlying objects. This is true even if the grantee already has the `READ` or `SELECT` privilege on those underlying objects.
**Restriction on Object Privileges**
A privilege cannot appear more than once in the list of privileges to be granted.
**ALL [PRIVILEGES]**
Specify `ALL` to grant all the privileges for the object that you have been granted with the `GRANT` `OPTION`. The user who owns the schema containing an object automatically has all privileges on the object with the `GRANT` `OPTION`. The keyword `PRIVILEGES` is provided for semantic clarity and is optional.
***column***
Specify the table or view column on which privileges are to be granted. You can specify columns only when granting the `INSERT`, `REFERENCES`, or `UPDATE` privilege. If you do not list columns, then the grantee has the specified privilege on all columns in the table or view.
For information on existing column object grants, query the `USER_`, `ALL_`, or `DBA_COL_PRIVS` data dictionary view.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Reference* for information on the data dictionary views and “Granting Multiple Object Privileges on Individual Columns: Example”
***on_object_clause***
The *on_object_clause* identifies the object on which the privileges are granted. Users, directory objects, editions, data mining models, Java source and resource schema objects, and SQL translation profiles are identified separately because they reside in separate namespaces.
**See Also:**   “Granting Object Privileges to a Role: Example”
***object***
Specify the schema object on which the privileges are to be granted. If you do not qualify *object* with *schema*, then the database assumes the object is in your own schema. The object can be one of the following types:
- Table, view, or materialized view
- Sequence
- Procedure, function, or package
- User-defined type
- Synonym for any of the preceding items
- Directory, library, operator, or indextype
- Java source, class, or resource
You cannot grant privileges directly to a single partition of a partitioned table.
**See Also:**   “Granting Object Privileges on a Table to a User: Example”, “Granting Object Privileges on a View: Example”, and “Granting Object Privileges to a Sequence in Another Schema: Example”
**ON USER**
Specify one or more database user on whom privileges are to be granted.
**Restriction on Granting Privileges on Users**
You cannot grant privileges on user `PUBLIC`.
**See Also:**   “Granting an Object Privilege on a User: Example”
**ON DIRECTORY**
Specify the name of the directory object on which privileges are to be granted. You cannot qualify *directory_name* with a schema name.
**See Also:**   CREATE DIRECTORY and “Granting an Object Privilege on a Directory: Example”
**ON EDITION**
Specify the name of the edition on which the `USE` object privilege is to be granted. You cannot qualify *edition_name* with a schema name.
**ON MINING MODEL**
Specify the name of the mining model on which privileges are to be granted. If you do not qualify *mining_model_name* with *schema*, then the database assumes that the mining model is in your own schema.
**ON JAVA SOURCE | RESOURCE**
Specify the name of the Java source or resource schema object on which privileges are to be granted. If you do not qualify *object* with *schema*, then the database assumes that the object is in your own schema.
**See Also:**   CREATE JAVA
**ON SQL TRANSLATION PROFILE**
Specify the name of the SQL translation profile on which privileges are to be granted. If you do not qualify *profile* with *schema*, then the database assumes that the profile is in your own schema.
**WITH HIERARCHY OPTION**
Specify `WITH` `HIERARCHY` `OPTION` to grant the specified object privilege on all subobjects of *object*, such as subviews created under a view, including subobjects created subsequent to this statement.
This clause is meaningful only in combination with the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege.
**WITH GRANT OPTION**
Specify `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION` to enable the grantee to grant the object privileges to other users and roles.
If you grant an object privilege to a user without specifying `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION`, and then subsequently grant the privilege to the user `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION`, then the user has the `GRANT` `OPTION` on the privilege.
To revoke the `GRANT` `OPTION` on an object privilege from a user, you must revoke the privilege from the user altogether and then grant the privilege to the user without the `GRANT` `OPTION`.
**Restriction on Granting WITH GRANT OPTION**
You can specify `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION` only when granting to a user or to `PUBLIC`, not when granting to a role.
## *grant_roles_to_programs*
Use this clause to grant roles to program units. Such roles are called code based access control (CBAC) roles.
***role***
Specify the role you want to grant. You can grant an Oracle Database predefined role or a user-defined role. The role must have been created by or directly granted to the schema owner of the program unit.
***program_unit***
Specify the program unit to which the role is to be granted. You can specify a PL/SQL function, procedure, or package. If you do not specify *schema*, then Oracle Database assumes the function, procedure, or package is in your own schema.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Security Guide* for more information on granting code based access control roles to program units
## CONTAINER Clause
If the current container is a pluggable database (PDB):
  ``````- Specify CONTAINER = CURRENT to locally grant a system privilege, object privilege, or role to a user or role. The privilege or role is granted to the user or role only in the current PDB.
If the current container is the root:
``````
- Specify CONTAINER = CURRENT to locally grant a system privilege, object privilege, or role to a common user or common role. The privilege or role is granted to the user or role only in the root.
``````
- Specify CONTAINER = ALL to commonly grant a system privilege, object privilege on a common object, or role, to a common user or common role.
If you omit this clause, then `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT` is the default.
  **Note:**   If you specify the `CONTAINER` clause when granting a privilege or role, then the current container must be the same container and you must specify the same `CONTAINER` clause when you revoke the privilege or role. Refer to the CONTAINER Clause of the `REVOKE` statement for more information.

Table 2 Object Privileges (Organized by the Database Object Operated Upon)

| Object Privilege Name | Operations Authorized |
|---|---|
| ANALYTIC VIEW PRIVILEGES | The following analytic view privileges authorize operations on analytic views. |
| ALTER | Rename the analytic view. |
| READ | Query the object with the SELECT statement. |
| SELECT | Query the object with the SELECT statement. |
| ATTRIBUTE DIMENSION PRIVILEGES | The following attribute dimension privileges authorize operations on attribute dimensions.. |
| ALTER | Rename the attribute dimension. |
| DIRECTORY PRIVILEGES | The following directory privileges provide secured access to the files stored in the operating system directory to which the directory object serves as a pointer. The directory object contains the full path name of the operating system directory where the files reside. Because the files are actually stored outside the database, Oracle Database server processes also need to have appropriate file permissions on the file system server. Granting object privileges on the directory database object to individual database users, rather than on the operating system, allows the database to enforce security during file operations. |
| READ | Read files in the directory. |
| WRITE  | Write files in the directory. This privilege is useful only in connection with external tables. It allows the grantee to determine whether the external table agent can write a log file or a bad file to the directory.Restriction: This privilege does not allow the grantee to write to a BFILE. |
| EXECUTE | Execute a preprocessor program that resides in the directory. A preprocessor program converts data to a supported format when loading data records from an external table with the ORACLE_LOADER access driver. Refer to Oracle Database Utilities for more information. This privilege does not implicitly allow READ access on the external table data. |
| EDITION PRIVILEGE | The following edition privilege authorizes the use of an edition. |
| USE | Use an edition. |
| FLASHBACK DATA ARCHIVE PRIVILEGE | The following flashback data archive privilege authorizes operations on flashback data archives. |
| FLASHBACK ARCHIVE | Enable or disable historical tracking for a table. |
| HIERARCHY PRIVILEGES | The following hierarchy privileges authorize operations on hierarchies. |
| ALTER | Rename the hierarchy. |
| READ | Query the object with the SELECT statement. |
| SELECT | Query the object with the SELECT statement. |
| INDEXTYPE PRIVILEGE | The following indextype privilege authorizes operations on indextypes. |
| EXECUTE | Reference an indextype. |
| LIBRARY PRIVILEGE | The following library privilege authorizes operations on a library. |
| EXECUTE | Use and reference the specified object and invoke its methods.Caution: This extremely powerful privilege should be granted only to trusted users. Refer to Oracle Database Security Guide before granting this privilege. |
| MATERIALIZED VIEW PRIVILEGES | The following materialized view privileges authorize operations on a materialized view. The DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE privileges can be granted only to updatable materialized views. |
| ON COMMIT REFRESH  | Create a refresh-on-commit materialized view on the specified table. |
| QUERY REWRITE  | Create a materialized view for query rewrite using the specified table. |
| READ | Query the materialized view. |
| SELECT | Query the materialized view. Obtain row locks with the SELECT … FOR UPDATE or LOCK TABLE statement. |

| ALTER | Change the mining model name or the associated cost matrix using the applicable DBMS_DATA_MINING procedures. |
| SELECT | Score or view the mining model. Scoring is done with the PREDICTION family of SQL functions or with the DBMS_DATA_MINING.APPLY procedure. Viewing the model is done with the DBMS_DATA_MINING.GET_MODEL_DETAILS_* procedures. |
| OBJECT TYPE PRIVILEGES | The following object type privilegesauthorize operations on a database object type. |
| DEBUG | Access, through a debugger, all public and nonpublic variables, methods, and types defined on the object type.Place a breakpoint or stop at a line or instruction boundary within the type body. |
| EXECUTE | Use and reference the specified object and invoke its methods.Access, through a debugger, public variables, types, and methods defined on the object type. |
| UNDER | Create a subtype under this type. You can grant this object privilege only if you have the UNDER ANY TYPE privilege WITH GRANT OPTION on the immediate supertype of this type. |

| UPDATE | Update measure values of the OLAP cube or attribute values of the cube dimension. |
| OPERATOR PRIVILEGE | The following operator privilege authorizes operations on user-defined operators. |
| EXECUTE | Reference an operator. |
| PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, PACKAGE PRIVILEGES | The following procedure, function, and package privilegesauthorize operations on procedures, functions, and packages. These privileges also apply to Java sources, classes, and resources, which Oracle Database treats as though they were procedures for purposes of granting object privileges. |
| DEBUG | Access, through a debugger, all public and nonpublic variables, methods, and types defined on the object.Place a breakpoint or stop at a line or instruction boundary within the procedure, function, or package. This privilege grants access to the declarations in the method or package specification and body. |
| EXECUTE | Execute the procedure or function directly, or access any program object declared in the specification of a package, or compile the object implicitly during a call to a currently invalid or uncompiled function or procedure. This privilege does not allow the grantee to explicitly compile using ALTER PROCEDURE or ALTER FUNCTION. For explicit compilation you need the appropriate ALTER system privilege.Access, through a debugger, public variables, types, and methods defined on the procedure, function, or package. This privilege grants access to the declarations in the method or package specification only.Job scheduler objects are created using the DBMS_SCHEDULER package. After these objects are created, you can grant the EXECUTE object privilege on job scheduler classes and programs. You can also grant ALTER privilege on job scheduler jobs, programs, and schedules.Note: Users do not need this privilege to execute a procedure, function, or package indirectly. |
| SCHEDULER PRIVILEGES | Job scheduler objects are created using the DBMS_SCHEDULER package. After these objects are created, you can grant the following privileges. |
| EXECUTE | Operations on job classes, programs, chains, and credentials. |
| ALTER | Modifications to jobs, programs, chains, credentials, and schedules. |
| USE | Associate the specified scheduler resource object with programs and jobs. |
| SEQUENCE PRIVILEGES | The following sequence privileges authorize operations on a sequence. |

| KEEP SEQUENCE | The sequence pseudocolumn NEXTVAL retains its original value during replay for Application Continuity when the grantee is running the application. This privilege is useful for providing bind variable consistency when replaying after recoverable errors.If this privilege is granted or revoked between runtime and failover of a request, then the original value of NEXTVAL is not retained during replay for Application Continuity for that request.Note: This privilege is not granted by the GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sequence statement. You must explicitly grant this privilege.Note: This privilege is part of the DBA role. |
| SELECT | Examine and increment values of the sequence with the CURRVAL and NEXTVAL pseudocolumns. |
| SQL TRANSLATION PROFILE PRIVILEGES | The following SQL translation profile privileges authorize operations on a SQL translation profile. |
| ALTER | Alter the translator, custom SQL statement translations, or custom error translations of a SQL translation profile. |
| USE | Use a SQL translation profile. |
| SYNONYM PRIVILEGES | Synonym privilegesare the same as the privileges for the target object. Granting a privilege on a synonym is equivalent to granting the privilege on the base object. Similarly, granting a privilege on a base object is equivalent to granting the privilege on all synonyms for the object. If you grant to a user a privilege on a synonym, then the user can use either the synonym name or the base object name in the SQL statement that exercises the privilege. |
| TABLE PRIVILEGES | The following table privileges authorize operations on a table. Any one of following object privileges, except the READ privilege, allows the grantee to lock the table in any lock mode with the LOCK TABLE statement.Note: For external tables, the only valid object privileges are ALTER, READ, and SELECT. |
| ALTER | Change the table definition with the ALTER TABLE statement. |
| DEBUG  | Access, through a debugger: PL/SQL code in the body of any triggers defined on the tableInformation on SQL statements that reference the table directly |
| DELETE | Remove rows from the table with the DELETE statement.Note: You must grant the SELECT privilege on the table along with the DELETE privilege if the table is on a remote database. |
| INDEX | Create an index on the table with the CREATE INDEX statement. |
| INSERT | Add new rows to the table with the INSERT statement.Note: You must grant the SELECT privilege on the table along with the INSERT privilege if the table is on a remote database. |
| READ | Query the table with the SELECT statement. Does not allow SELECT … FOR UPDATE. |
| REFERENCES | Create a constraint that refers to the table. You cannot grant this privilege to a role. |
| SELECT | Query the table with the SELECT statement, including SELECT … FOR UPDATE. |
| UPDATE | Change data in the table with the UPDATE statement.Note: You must grant the SELECT privilege on the table along with the UPDATE privilege if the table is on a remote database. |
| USER PRIVILEGES | The following privileges authorize operations on a user. |
| INHERIT PRIVILEGES | Execute invoker’s rights procedures or functions owned by the grantee with the privileges of the invoker when the invoker is the user on whom this privilege is granted. |
| INHERIT REMOTE PRIVILEGES | Allow the user on whom this privilege is granted to execute definer’s rights procedures or functions that contain current user database links and are owned by the grantee. |
| TRANSLATE SQL | Translate SQL through the grantee’s SQL translation profile for the user on whom this privilege is granted. |
| VIEW PRIVILEGES | The following view privileges authorize operations on a view. Any one of the following object privileges, except the READ privilege, allows the grantee to lock the view in any lock mode with the LOCK TABLE statement.To grant a privilege on a view, you must have that privilege with the GRANT OPTION on all of the base tables of the view. |
| DEBUG  | Access, through a debugger: PL/SQL code in the body of any triggers defined on the viewInformation on SQL statements that reference the view directly |
| DELETE | Remove rows from the view with the DELETE statement. |
| INSERT | Add new rows to the view with the INSERT statement. |
| MERGE VIEW | This object privilege has the same behavior as the system privilege MERGE ANY VIEW, except that the privilege is limited to the views specified in the ON clause. For any query issued by the grantee on the specified views, the optimizer can use view merging to improve query performance without performing the checks that would otherwise be performed to ensure that view merging does not violate any security intentions of the view creator. |
| READ | Query the view with the SELECT statement. Does not allow SELECT … FOR UPDATE. |
| REFERENCES  | Define foreign key constraints on the view. |
| SELECT | Query the view with the SELECT statement, including SELECT ... FOR UPDATE.See Also: object_privilege for additional information on granting this object privilege on a view |
| UNDER | Create a subview under this view. You can grant this object privilege only if you have the UNDER ANY VIEW privilege WITH GRANT OPTION on the immediate superview of this view. |
| UPDATE | Change data in the view with the UPDATE statement. |

## Examples
**Granting a System Privilege to a User: Example**
To grant the `CREATE` `SESSION` system privilege to the sample user `hr`, allowing `hr` to log on to Oracle Database, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT CREATE SESSION
   TO hr;
```
**Assigning User Passwords When Granting a System Privilege: Example**
Assume that user `hr` exists and user `newuser` does not exist. The following statement resets the user `hr` password to *password1*, creates user `newuser` with *password2*, and grants both users the `CREATE` `SESSION` system privilege:
```
GRANT CREATE SESSION
  TO hr, newuser IDENTIFIED BY password1, password2;
```
**Granting System Privileges to a Role: Example**
The following statement grants appropriate system privileges to a data warehouse manager role, which was created in the “Creating a Role: Example”:
```
GRANT
     CREATE ANY MATERIALIZED VIEW
   , ALTER ANY MATERIALIZED VIEW
   , DROP ANY MATERIALIZED VIEW
   , QUERY REWRITE
   , GLOBAL QUERY REWRITE
   TO dw_manager
   WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```
The `dw_manager` privilege domain now contains the system privileges related to materialized views.
**Granting a Role with the ADMIN OPTION: Example**
To grant the `dw_manager` role with the `ADMIN` `OPTION` to the sample user `sh`, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT dw_manager
   TO sh
   WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```
User `sh` can now perform the following operations with the `dw_manager` role:
``````
- Enable the role and exercise any privileges in the privilege domain of the role, including the CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW system privilege
- Grant and revoke the role to and from other users
- Drop the role
````
- Grant and revoke the dw_manager role to and from program units in the sh schema
**Granting a Role with the DELEGATE OPTION: Example**
To grant the `dw_manager` role with the `DELEGATE` `OPTION` to the sample user `sh`, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT dw_manager
   TO sh
   WITH DELEGATE OPTION;
```
User `sh` can now grant and revoke the `dw_manager` role to and from program units in the `sh` schema.
**Granting Object Privileges to a Role: Example**
The following example grants the `SELECT` object privileges to a data warehouse user role, which was created in the “Creating a Role: Example”:
```
GRANT SELECT ON sh.sales TO warehouse_user;
```
**Granting a Role to a Role: Example**
The following statement grants the `warehouse_user` role to the `dw_manager` role. Both roles were created in the “Creating a Role: Example”:
```
GRANT warehouse_user TO dw_manager;
```
The `dw_manager` role now contains all of the privileges in the domain of the `warehouse_user` role.
**Granting an Object Privilege on a User: Example**
To grant the `INHERIT` `PRIVILEGES` object privilege on user `sh` to user `hr`, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT INHERIT PRIVILEGES ON USER sh TO hr;
```
**Granting an Object Privilege on a Directory: Example**
To grant `READ` on directory `bfile_dir` to user `hr`, with the `GRANT` `OPTION`, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY bfile_dir TO hr
   WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
**Granting Object Privileges on a Table to a User: Example**
To grant all privileges on the table `oe.bonuses`, which was created in “Merging into a Table: Example”, to the user `hr` with the `GRANT` `OPTION`, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT ALL ON bonuses TO hr
   WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
The user `hr` can subsequently perform the following operations:
- Exercise any privilege on the bonuses table
- Grant any privilege on the bonuses table to another user or role
**Granting Object Privileges on a View: Example**
To grant `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges on the view `emp_view`, which was created in “Creating a View: Example”, to all users, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE
   ON emp_view TO PUBLIC;
```
All users can subsequently query and update the view of employee details.
**Granting Object Privileges to a Sequence in Another Schema: Example**
To grant `SELECT` privilege on the `customers_seq` sequence in the schema `oe` to the user `hr`, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT SELECT
   ON oe.customers_seq TO hr;
```
The user `hr` can subsequently generate the next value of the sequence with the following statement:
```
SELECT oe.customers_seq.NEXTVAL
   FROM DUAL;
```
**Granting Multiple Object Privileges on Individual Columns: Example**
To grant to user `oe` the `REFERENCES` privilege on the `employee_id` column and the `UPDATE` privilege on the `employee_id`, `salary`, and `commission_pct` columns of the `employees` table in the schema `hr`, issue the following statement:
```
GRANT REFERENCES (employee_id),
      UPDATE (employee_id, salary, commission_pct)
   ON hr.employees
   TO oe;
```
The user `oe` can subsequently update values of the `employee_id`, `salary`, and `commission_pct` columns. User `oe` can also define referential integrity constraints that refer to the `employee_id` column. However, because the `GRANT` statement lists only these columns, `oe` cannot perform operations on any of the other columns of the `employees` table.
For example, `oe` can create a table with a constraint:
```
CREATE TABLE dependent
   (dependno   NUMBER,
    dependname VARCHAR2(10),
    employee   NUMBER
   CONSTRAINT in_emp REFERENCES hr.employees(employee_id) );
```
The constraint `in_emp` ensures that all dependents in the `dependent` table correspond to an employee in the `employees` table in the schema `hr`.
