# DROP SEQUENCE

## Purpose
Use the `DROP` `SEQUENCE` statement to remove a sequence from the database.
You can also use this statement to restart a sequence by dropping and then re-creating it. For example, if you have a sequence with a current value of 150 and you would like to restart the sequence with a value of 27, then you can drop the sequence and then re-create it with the same name and a `START` `WITH` value of 27.
**See Also:**   CREATE SEQUENCE and ALTER SEQUENCE for more information on creating and modifying a sequence
## Prerequisites
The sequence must be in your own schema or you must have the `DROP` `ANY` `SEQUENCE` system privilege.
## Syntax
## *drop_sequence*::=
Description of the illustration drop_sequence.eps
## Semantics
## IF EXISTS
Specify `IF EXISTS` to drop an existing sequence.
## *schema*
Specify the schema containing the sequence. If you omit *schema*, then Oracle Database assumes the sequence is in your own schema.
## *sequence_name*
Specify the name of the sequence to be dropped.
## Examples
**Dropping a Sequence: Example**
The following statement drops the sequence `customers_seq` owned by the user `oe`, which was created in “Creating a Sequence: Example”. To issue this statement, you must either be connected as user `oe` or have the `DROP` `ANY` `SEQUENCE` system privilege:
```
DROP SEQUENCE oe.customers_seq;
```
