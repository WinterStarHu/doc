# BITMAP_COUNT

## Syntax

## Purpose
`BITMAP_COUNT` is a scalar function that returns the 1-bit count for the input bitmap.
The argument `expr` is of type `BLOB`.
It returns a `NUMBER` representing the count of bits set in its input.
If `expr` is NULL, it returns 0.
**Restrictions**
The argument must be of type `BLOB`type. The argument is expected to be a bitmap produced by `BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG` or, recursively, by `BITMAP_OR_AGG`. Any other input results in `ORA-62578`:
```
62578, 00000, "The input is not a valid bitmap produced by BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT related operators."
// *Cause: An attempt was made to pass a bitmap that was not produced by one of the BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT operators.
// *Action: Only pass bitmaps constructed via BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG or BITMAP_OR_AGG to BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT related operators.
```
