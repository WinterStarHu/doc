## Purpose
Use `BITMAP_BIT_POSITION` to construct the one-to-one mapping between a number and a bit position.
The argument `expr` is of type `NUMBER`. It is the absolute bit position in the bitmap.
`BITMAP_BIT_POSITION` returns a `NUMBER`, the relative bit position.
If `expr` is NULL, the function returns NULL.
If `expr` is not an integer, you will see the following error message:
```
Invalid value has been passed to a BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT related operator.
```
