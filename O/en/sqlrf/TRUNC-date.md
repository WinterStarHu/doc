## Purpose
The `TRUNC` (date) function returns *date* with the time portion of the day truncated to the unit specified by the format model *fmt*. This function is not sensitive to the `NLS_CALENDAR` session parameter. It operates according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar. The value returned is always of data type `DATE`, even if you specify a different datetime data type for *date*. If you omit *fmt*, then the default format model ‘`DD`’ is used and the value returned is *date* truncated to the day with a time of midnight. Refer to “ROUND and TRUNC Date Functions” for the permitted format models to use in *fmt*.
## Examples
The following example truncates a date:
```
SELECT TRUNC(TO_DATE('27-OCT-92','DD-MON-YY'), 'YEAR')
  "New Year" FROM DUAL;
New Year
---------
01-JAN-92
```
**Formatting Dates using TRUNC: Examples**
In the following example, the `TRUNC` function returns the input date with the time portion of the day truncated as specified in the format model:
```
WITH dates AS (
  SELECT date'2015-01-01' d FROM dual union
  SELECT date'2015-01-10' d FROM dual union
  SELECT date'2015-02-01' d FROM dual union
  SELECT timestamp'2015-03-03 23:45:00' d FROM dual union
  SELECT timestamp'2015-04-11 12:34:56' d FROM dual
)
SELECT d "Original Date",
       trunc(d) "Nearest Day, Time Removed",
       trunc(d, 'ww') "Nearest Week",
       trunc(d, 'iw') "Start of Week",
       trunc(d, 'mm') "Start of Month",
       trunc(d, 'year') "Start of Year"
FROM dates;
```
In the following example, the input date values are truncated and the `TO_CHAR` function is used to obtain the minute component of the truncated date values:
```
WITH dates AS (
  SELECT date'2015-01-01' d FROM dual union
  SELECT date'2015-01-10' d FROM dual union
  SELECT date'2015-02-01' d FROM dual union
  SELECT timestamp'2015-03-03 23:45:00' d FROM dual union
  SELECT timestamp'2015-04-11 12:34:56' d FROM dual
)
SELECT d "Original Date",
       trunc(d) "Date with Time Removed",
       to_char(trunc(d, 'mi'), 'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi') "Nearest Minute",
       trunc(d, 'iw') "Start of Week",
       trunc(d, 'mm') "Start of Month",
       trunc(d, 'year') "Start of Year"
FROM dates;
```
The following statement alters the date format for the current session:
```
ALTER SESSION SET nls_date_format = 'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi';
```
In the following example, the data is displayed in the new date format:
```
WITH dates AS (
  SELECT date'2015-01-01' d FROM dual union
  SELECT date'2015-01-10' d FROM dual union
  SELECT date'2015-02-01' d FROM dual union
  SELECT timestamp'2015-03-03 23:44:32' d FROM dual union
  SELECT timestamp'2015-04-11 12:34:56' d FROM dual
)
SELECT d "Original Date",
       trunc(d) "Date, time removed",
       to_char(trunc(d, 'mi'), 'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi') "Nearest Minute",
       trunc(d, 'iw') "Start of Week",
       trunc(d, 'mm') "Start of Month",
       trunc(d, 'year') "Start of Year"
FROM dates;
```
