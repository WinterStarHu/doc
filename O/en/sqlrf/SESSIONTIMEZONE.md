## Purpose
`SESSIONTIMEZONE` returns the time zone of the current session. The return type is a time zone offset (a character type in the format `'[+|-]TZH:TZM'`) or a time zone region name, depending on how the user specified the session time zone value in the most recent `ALTER` `SESSION` statement.
**Note:**   The default client session time zone is an offset even if the client operating system uses a named time zone. If you want the default session time zone to use a named time zone, then set the `ORA_SDTZ` variable in the client environment to an Oracle time zone region name. Refer to *Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide* for more information on this variable.
**See Also:**   in *Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide* for the collation derivation rules, which define the collation assigned to the character return value of `SESSIONTIMEZONE`
## Examples
The following example returns the time zone of the current session:
```
SELECT SESSIONTIMEZONE FROM DUAL;
SESSION
-------
-08:00
```
