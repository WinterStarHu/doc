# INSERT

## Purpose
Use the `INSERT` statement to add rows to a table, the base table of a view, a partition of a partitioned table or a subpartition of a composite-partitioned table, or an object table or the base table of an object view.
## Prerequisites
For you to insert rows into a table, the table must be in your own schema or you must have the `INSERT` object privilege on the table.
For you to insert rows into the base table of a view, the owner of the schema containing the view must have the `INSERT` object privilege on the base table. Also, if the view is in a schema other than your own, then you must have the `INSERT` object privilege on the view.
If you have the `INSERT` `ANY` `TABLE` system privilege, then you can also insert rows into any table or the base table of any view.
You must also have the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege on the table into which you want to insert rows if the table is on a remote database.
To specify the *returning_clause*, you must have the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege on the object.
If the `SQL92_SECURITY` initialization parameter is set to `TRUE` and the `INSERT` operation references table columns, such as the columns in a *returning_clause*, then you must have the `SELECT` object privilege on the object into which you want to insert rows.
Conventional and Direct-Path INSERT
You can use the `INSERT` statement to insert data into a table, partition, or view in two ways: conventional `INSERT` and direct-path `INSERT`. When you issue a conventional `INSERT` statement, Oracle Database reuses free space in the table into which you are inserting and maintains referential integrity constraints. With direct-path `INSERT`, the database appends the inserted data after existing data in the table. Data is written directly into data files, bypassing the buffer cache. Free space in the existing data is not reused. This alternative enhances performance during insert operations and is similar to the functionality of the Oracle direct-path loader utility, SQL*Loader. When you insert into a table that has been created in parallel mode, direct-path `INSERT` is the default.
The manner in which the database generates redo and undo data depends in part on whether you are using conventional or direct-path `INSERT`:
- Conventional INSERT always generates maximal redo and undo for changes to both data and metadata, regardless of the logging setting of the table and the archivelog and force logging settings of the database.
****
  - Direct-path INSERT always bypasses undo generation for data changes.
``````
  - If the database is not in ARCHIVELOG or FORCE LOGGING mode, then no redo is generated for data changes, regardless of the logging setting of the table.
````````````
  - If the database is in ARCHIVELOG mode (but not in FORCE LOGGING mode), then direct-path INSERT generates data redo for LOGGING tables but not for NOLOGGING tables.
****````````
  - If the database is in ARCHIVELOG and FORCE LOGGING mode, then direct-path SQL generate data redo for both LOGGING and NOLOGGING tables.
Direct-path `INSERT` is subject to a number of restrictions. If any of these restrictions is violated, then Oracle Database executes conventional `INSERT` serially without returning any message, unless otherwise noted:
- You can have multiple direct-path INSERT statements in a single transaction, with or without other DML statements. However, after one DML statement alters a particular table, partition, or index, no other DML statement in the transaction can access that table, partition, or index.
- Queries that access the same table, partition, or index are allowed before the direct-path INSERT statement, but not after it.
- If any serial or parallel statement attempts to access a table that has already been modified by a direct-path INSERT in the same transaction, then the database returns an error and rejects the statement.
- The target table cannot be of a cluster.
- The target table cannot contain object type columns.
- Direct-path INSERT is not supported for an index-organized table (IOT) if it has a mapping table, or if it is reference by a materialized view.
````````
- Direct-path INSERT into a single partition of an index-organized table (IOT), into a partitioned IOT with only one partition, or into an IOT that is not partitioned, will be done serially, even if the IOT was created in parallel mode or you specify the APPEND or APPEND_VALUES hint. However, direct-path INSERT operations into a partitioned IOT will honor parallel mode as long as the partition-extended name is not used and the IOT has more than one partition.
- The target table cannot have any triggers or referential integrity constraints defined on it.
- The target table cannot be replicated.
- A transaction containing a direct-path INSERT statement cannot be or become distributed.
You cannot query or modify direct-path inserted data immediately after the insert is complete. If you attempt to do so, an `ORA-12838` error is generated. You must first issue a `COMMIT` statement before attempting to read or modify the newly-inserted data.

## Semantics
## *hint*
Specify a comment that passes instructions to the optimizer on choosing an execution plan for the statement.
For a multitable insert, if you specify the `PARALLEL` hint for any target table, then the entire multitable insert statement is parallelized even if the target tables have not been created or altered with `PARALLEL` specified. If you do not specify the `PARALLEL` hint, then the insert operation will not be parallelized unless all target tables were created or altered with `PARALLEL` specified.
**See Also:**
- “Hints” for the syntax and description of hints
- “Restrictions on Multitable Inserts”
## *single_table_insert*
In a **single-table insert**, you insert values into one row of a table, view, or materialized view by specifying values explicitly or by retrieving the values through a subquery.
**You can use the *flashback_query_clause* in *subquery* to insert past data into *table*. Refer to the *flashback_query_clause* of `SELECT` for more information on this clause.
**Restriction on Single-table Inserts**
If you retrieve values through a subquery, then the select list of the subquery must have the same number of columns as the column list of the `INSERT` statement. If you omit the column list, then the subquery must provide values for every column in the table.
**See Also:**   “Inserting Values into Tables: Examples”
## *insert_into_clause*
Use the `INSERT` `INTO` clause to specify the target object or objects into which the database is to insert data.
## *DML_table_expression_clause*
Use the `INTO` *DML_table_expression_clause* to specify the objects into which data is being inserted.
***schema***
Specify the schema containing the table, view, or materialized view. If you omit *schema*, then the database assumes the object is in your own schema.
***table*** **|** ***view*** **|** ***materialized_view*** **|** ***subquery***
Specify the name of the table or object table, view or object view, materialized view, or the column or columns returned by a subquery, into which rows are to be inserted. If you specify a view or object view, then the database inserts rows into the base table of the view.
You cannot insert rows into a read-only materialized view. If you insert rows into a writable materialized view, then the database inserts the rows into the underlying container table. However, the insertions are overwritten at the next refresh operation. If you insert rows into an updatable materialized view that is part of a materialized view group, then the database also inserts the corresponding rows into the master table.
If any value to be inserted is a `REF` to an object table, and if the object table has a primary key object identifier, then the column into which you insert the `REF` must be a `REF` column with a referential integrity or `SCOPE` constraint to the object table.
If *table*, or the base table of *view*, contains one or more domain index columns, then this statement executes the appropriate indextype insert routine.
Issuing an `INSERT` statement against a table fires any `INSERT` triggers defined on the table.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Data Cartridge Developer’s Guide* for more information on these routines
**Restrictions on the** ***DML_table_expression_clause***
This clause is subject to the following restrictions:
****````
- You cannot execute this statement if table or the base table of view contains any domain indexes marked IN_PROGRESS or FAILED.
- You cannot insert into a partition if any affected index partitions are marked UNUSABLE.
````****
- With regard to the ORDER BY clause of the subquery in the DML_table_expression_clause, ordering is guaranteed only for the rows being inserted, and only within each extent of the table. Ordering of new rows with respect to existing rows is not guaranteed.
``````
- If a view was created using the WITH CHECK OPTION, then you can insert into the view only rows that satisfy the defining query of the view.
**
- If a view was created using a single base table, then you can insert rows into the view and then retrieve those values using the returning_clause.
````
  - A set operator
  - A DISTINCT operator
  - An aggregate or analytic function
``````````````````
  - A GROUP BY, ORDER BY, MODEL, CONNECT BY, or START WITH clause
  - A collection expression in a SELECT list
  - A subquery in a SELECT list
  - A subquery designated WITH READ ONLY
**
  - Joins, with some exceptions, as documented in Oracle Database Administrator’s Guide
-
``````````
- If you specify an index, index partition, or index subpartition that has been marked UNUSABLE, then the INSERT statement will fail unless the SKIP_UNUSABLE_INDEXES session parameter has been set to TRUE. Refer to ALTER SESSION for information on the SKIP_UNUSABLE_INDEXES session parameter.
***partition_extension_clause***
Specify the name or partition key value of the partition or subpartition within *table*, or the base table of *view*, targeted for inserts.
If a row to be inserted does not map into a specified partition or subpartition, then the database returns an error.
**Restriction on Target Partitions and Subpartitions**
This clause is not valid for object tables or object views.
**See Also:**   “References to Partitioned Tables and Indexes”
***dblink***
Specify a complete or partial name of a database link to a remote database where the table or view is located.
You can insert rows into a remote table or view only if you are using Oracle Database distributed functionality.
To insert rows into a remote table you must have both `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on the table.
If you omit *dblink*, then Oracle Database assumes that the table or view is on the local database. You can insert rows into a local table with just the `INSERT` privilege.
**Note:**   Starting with Oracle Database 12*c* Release 2 (12.2), the `INSERT` statement accepts remote LOB locators as bind variables. Refer to the “Distributed LOBs” chapter in *Oracle Database SecureFiles and Large Objects Developer’s Guide* for more information.
**See Also:**
- “Syntax for Schema Objects and Parts in SQL Statements” and “References to Objects in Remote Databases” for information on referring to database links
- “Inserting into a Remote Database: Example”
***subquery_restriction_clause***
Use the *subquery_restriction_clause* to restrict the subquery in one of the following ways:
**WITH READ ONLY**
Specify `WITH READ ONLY` to indicate that the table or view cannot be updated.
**WITH CHECK OPTION**
Specify `WITH CHECK OPTION` to indicate that Oracle Database prohibits any changes to the table or view that would produce rows that are not included in the subquery. When used in the subquery of a DML statement, you can specify this clause in a subquery in the `FROM` clause but not in subquery in the `WHERE` clause.
**CONSTRAINT** ***constraint***
Specify the name of the `CHECK OPTION` constraint. If you omit this identifier, then Oracle automatically assigns the constraint a name of the form `SYS_C`*n*, where n is an integer that makes the constraint name unique within the database.
**See Also:**   “Using the WITH CHECK OPTION Clause: Example”
***table_collection_expression***
The *table_collection_expression* lets you inform Oracle that the value of *collection_expression* should be treated as a table for purposes of query and DML operations. The *collection_expression* can be a subquery, a column, a function, or a collection constructor. Regardless of its form, it must return a collection value-that is, a value whose type is nested table or varray. This process of extracting the elements of a collection is called **collection unnesting**.
The optional plus (+) is relevant if you are joining the `TABLE` collection expression with the parent table. The + creates an outer join of the two, so that the query returns rows from the outer table even if the collection expression is null.
**Note:**   In earlier releases of Oracle, when *collection_expression* was a subquery, *table_collection_expression* was expressed as `THE` *subquery*. That usage is now deprecated.
**See Also:**   “Table Collections: Examples”
***t_alias***
Specify a **correlation name**, which is an alias for the table, view, materialized view, or subquery to be referenced elsewhere in the statement.
**Restriction on Table Aliases**
You cannot specify *t_alias* during a multitable insert.
***column***
Specify a column of the table, view, or materialized view. In the inserted row, each column in this list is assigned a value from the *values_clause* or the subquery. If you want to assign a value to an `INVISIBLE` column, then you must include the column in this list.
If you omit one or more of the table’s columns from this list, then the column value of that column for the inserted row is the column default value as specified when the table was created or last altered. If any omitted column has a `NOT` `NULL` constraint and no default value, then the database returns an error indicating that the constraint has been violated and rolls back the `INSERT` statement. Refer to CREATE TABLE****for more information on default column values.
If you omit the column list altogether, then the *values_clause* or query must specify values for all columns in the table.
## *values_clause*
For a **single-table insert** operation, specify a row of values to be inserted into the table or view. You must specify a value in the *values_clause* for each column in the column list. If you omit the column list, then the *values_clause* must provide values for every column in the table.
For a **multitable insert** operation, each expression in the *values_clause* must refer to columns returned by the select list of the subquery. If you omit the *values_clause*, then the select list of the subquery determines the values to be inserted, so it must have the same number of columns as the column list of the corresponding *insert_into_clause*. If you do not specify a column list in the *insert_into_clause*, then the computed row must provide values for all columns in the target table.
For both types of insert operations, if you specify a column list in the *insert_into_clause*, then the database assigns to each column in the list a corresponding value from the values clause or the subquery. You can specify `DEFAULT` for any value in the *values_clause*. If you have specified a default value for the corresponding column of the table or view, then that value is inserted. If no default value for the corresponding column has been specified, then the database inserts null. Refer to “About SQL Expressions” and SELECT for syntax of valid expressions.
**Restrictions on Inserted Values**
The value are subject to the following restrictions:
````
****
````
  - BFILENAME for information on initializing BFILE values and for an example of inserting into a BFILE
**
  - Oracle Database SecureFiles and Large Objects Developer’s Guide for information on initializing BFILE locators
**
- When inserting into a list-partitioned table, you cannot insert a value into the partitioning key column that does not already exist in the partition_key_value list of one of the partitions.
- You cannot specify DEFAULT when inserting into a view.

  - “Inserting into a Substitutable Tables and Columns: Examples”, “Inserting Using the TO_LOB Function: Example”, “Inserting Sequence Values: Example”, and “Inserting Using Bind Variables: Example”
## *returning_clause*
The returning clause retrieves the rows affected by a DML statement. You can specify this clause for tables and materialized views and for views with a single base table.
When operating on a single row, a DML statement with a *returning_clause* can retrieve column expressions using the affected row, rowid, and `REFs` to the affected row and store them in host variables or PL/SQL variables.
When operating on multiple rows, a DML statement with the *returning_clause* stores values from expressions, rowids, and `REFs` involving the affected rows in bind arrays.
***expr***
Each item in the *expr* list must be a valid expression syntax.
**INTO**
The `INTO` clause indicates that the values of the changed rows are to be stored in the variable(s) specified in *data_item* list.
***data_item***
Each *data_item* is a host variable or PL/SQL variable that stores the retrieved *expr* value.
For each expression in the `RETURNING` list, you must specify a corresponding type-compatible PL/SQL variable or host variable in the `INTO` list.
**Restrictions**
The following restrictions apply to the `RETURNING` clause:
**
````******````
  - For UPDATE and DELETE statements each expr must be a simple expression or a single-set aggregate function expression. You cannot combine simple expressions and single-set aggregate function expressions in the same returning_clause. For INSERT statements, each expr must be a simple expression. Aggregate functions are not supported in an INSERT statement RETURNING clause.
  - Single-set aggregate function expressions cannot include the DISTINCT keyword.
**````````
- If the expr list contains a primary key column or other NOT NULL column, then the update statement fails if the table has a BEFORE UPDATE trigger defined on it.
**
- You cannot specify the returning_clause for a multitable insert.
- You cannot use this clause with parallel DML or with remote objects.
- You cannot retrieve LONG types with this clause.
````******````
- You cannot specify this clause for a view on which an INSTEAD OF trigger has been defined. See Also: Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference for information on using the BULK COLLECT clause to return multiple values to collection variables
## *multi_table_insert*
In a **multitable insert**, you insert computed rows derived from the rows returned from the evaluation of a subquery into one or more tables.
Table aliases are not defined by the select list of the subquery. Therefore, they are not visible in the clauses dependent on the select list. For example, this can happen when trying to refer to an object column in an expression. To use an expression with a table alias, you must put the expression into the select list with a column alias, and then refer to the column alias in the `VALUES` clause or `WHEN` condition of the multitable insert.
**ALL** ***into_clause***
Specify `ALL` followed by multiple *insert_into_clauses* to perform an **unconditional multitable insert**. Oracle Database executes each *insert_into_clause* once for each row returned by the subquery.
***conditional_insert_clause***
Specify the *conditional_insert_clause* to perform a **conditional multitable insert**. Oracle Database filters each *insert_into_clause* through the corresponding `WHEN` condition, which determines whether that *insert_into_clause* is executed. Each expression in the `WHEN` condition must refer to columns returned by the select list of the subquery. A single multitable insert statement can contain up to 127 `WHEN` clauses.
**ALL**
If you specify `ALL`, the default value, then the database evaluates each `WHEN` clause regardless of the results of the evaluation of any other `WHEN` clause. For each `WHEN` clause whose condition evaluates to true, the database executes the corresponding `INTO` clause list.
**FIRST**
If you specify `FIRST`, then the database evaluates each `WHEN` clause in the order in which it appears in the statement. For the first `WHEN` clause that evaluates to true, the database executes the corresponding `INTO` clause and skips subsequent `WHEN` clauses for the given row.
**ELSE clause**
For a given row, if no `WHEN` clause evaluates to true, then:
``````
- If you have specified an ELSE clause, then the database executes the INTO clause list associated with the ELSE clause.
****
- If you did not specify an else clause, then the database takes no action for that row. See Also: “Multitable Inserts: Examples”
**Restrictions on Multitable Inserts**
Multitable inserts are subject to the following restrictions:
- You can perform multitable inserts only on tables, not on views or materialized views.
- You cannot perform a multitable insert into a remote table.
- You cannot specify a TABLE collection expression when performing a multitable insert.
- Multitable inserts are not parallelized if any target table is index organized or if any target table has a bitmap index defined on it.
- Plan stability is not supported for multitable insert statements.
- You cannot specify a sequence in any part of a multitable insert statement. A multitable insert is considered a single SQL statement. Therefore, the first reference to NEXTVAL generates the next number, and all subsequent references in the statement return the same number.
## *subquery*
Specify a subquery that returns rows that are inserted into the table. The subquery can refer to any table, view, or materialized view, including the target tables of the `INSERT` statement. If the subquery selects no rows, then the database inserts no rows into the table.
You can use *subquery* in combination with the `TO_LOB` function to convert the values in a `LONG` column to LOB values in another column in the same or another table.
- To migrate LONG values to LOB values in another column in a view, you must perform the migration on the base table and then add the LOB column to the view.
``````**
- To migrate LONG values on a remote table to LOB values in a local table, you must perform the migration on the remote table using the TO_LOB function, and then perform an INSERT ... subquery operation to copy the LOB values from the remote table into the local table.
**Notes on Inserting with a Subquery**
The following notes apply when inserting with a subquery:
****
********
- If subquery returns the partial or total equivalent of a materialized view, then the database may use the materialized view for query rewrite in place of one or more tables specified in subquery. See Also: Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide**for more information on materialized views and query rewrite
********
- If subquery refers to remote objects, then the INSERT operation can run in parallel as long as the reference does not loop back to an object on the local database. However, if the subquery in the DML_table_expression_clause refers to any remote objects, then the INSERT operation will run serially without notification. See parallel_clause for more information.

```
- If subquery includes an ORDER BY clause, then it will override row ordering specified using attribute clustering table properties. <div class="infoboxnote" markdown="1">
## *error_logging_clause*
The *error_logging_clause* lets you capture DML errors and the log column values of the affected rows and save them in an error logging table.
**INTO** ***table***
Specify the name of the error logging table. If you omit this clause, then the database assigns the default name generated by the `DBMS_ERRLOG` package. The default error log table name is `ERR$_` followed by the first 25 characters of the name of the table upon which the DML operation is being executed.
***simple_expression***
Specify the value to be used as a statement tag, so that you can identify the errors from this statement in the error logging table. The expression can be either a text literal, a number literal, or a general SQL expression such as a bind variable. You can also use a function expression if you convert it to a text literal - for example, `TO_CHAR(SYSDATE)`.
**REJECT LIMIT**
This clause lets you specify an integer as an upper limit for the number of errors to be logged before the statement terminates and rolls back any changes made by the statement. The default rejection limit is zero. For parallel DML operations, the reject limit is applied to each parallel server.
**Restrictions on DML Error Logging**
  - Violated deferred constraints.
````
  - Any direct-path INSERT or MERGE operation that raises a unique constraint or index violation.
````
  - Any update operation UPDATE or MERGE that raises a unique constraint or index violation.
  - If you create or modify the corresponding error logging table so that it contains a column of an unsupported type, and if the name of that column corresponds to an unsupported column in the target DML table, then the DML statement fails at parse time.
  - If the error logging table does not contain any unsupported column types, then all DML errors are logged until the reject limit of errors is reached. For rows on which errors occur, column values with corresponding columns in the error logging table are logged along with the control information.
**See Also:**
**````**
- Oracle Database PL/SQL Packages and Types Reference for information on using the create_error_log procedure of the DBMS_ERRLOG package and Oracle Database Administrator’s Guide for general information on DML error logging.

## Examples
**Inserting Values into Tables: Example**s
The following statement inserts a row into the sample table `departments`:
```
INSERT INTO departments
   VALUES (280, 'Recreation', 121, 1700);
```
If the `departments` table had been created with a default value of 121 for the `manager_id` column, then you could issue the same statement as follows:
```
INSERT INTO departments
   VALUES (280, 'Recreation', DEFAULT, 1700);
```
The following statement inserts a row with six columns into the `employees` table. One of these columns is assigned `NULL` and another is assigned a number in scientific notation:
```
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, last_name, email,
      hire_date, job_id, salary, commission_pct)
   VALUES (207, 'Gregory', 'pgregory@example.com',
      sysdate, 'PU_CLERK', 1.2E3, NULL);
```
The following statement has the same effect as the preceding example, but uses a subquery in the *DML_table_expression_clause*:
```
INSERT INTO
   (SELECT employee_id, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id,
      salary, commission_pct FROM employees)
   VALUES (207, 'Gregory', 'pgregory@example.com',
      sysdate, 'PU_CLERK', 1.2E3, NULL);
```
**Inserting Values with a Subquery: Example**
The following statement copies employees whose commission exceeds 25% of their salary into the `bonuses` table, which was created in “Merging into a Table: Example”:
```
INSERT INTO bonuses
   SELECT employee_id, salary*1.1
   FROM employees
   WHERE commission_pct > 0.25;
```
**Inserting Into a Table with Error Logging: Example**
The following statements create a `raises` table in the sample schema `hr`, create an error logging table using the `DBMS_ERRLOG` package, and populate the `raises` table with data from the `employees` table. One of the inserts violates the check constraint on `raises`, and that row can be seen in `errlog`. If more than ten errors had occurred, then the statement would have aborted, rolling back any insertions made:
```
CREATE TABLE raises (emp_id NUMBER, sal NUMBER
   CONSTRAINT check_sal CHECK(sal > 8000));
EXECUTE DBMS_ERRLOG.CREATE_ERROR_LOG('raises', 'errlog');
```
```
INSERT INTO raises
   SELECT employee_id, salary*1.1 FROM employees
   WHERE commission_pct > .2
   LOG ERRORS INTO errlog ('my_bad') REJECT LIMIT 10;
SELECT ORA_ERR_MESG$, ORA_ERR_TAG$, emp_id, sal FROM errlog;
ORA_ERR_MESG$               ORA_ERR_TAG$         EMP_ID SAL
--------------------------- -------------------- ------ -------
ORA-02290: check constraint my_bad               161    7700
 (HR.SYS_C004266) violated
```
**Inserting into a Remote Database: Example**
The following statement inserts a row into the `employees` table owned by the user `hr` on the database accessible by the database link `remote`:
```
INSERT INTO employees@remote
   VALUES (8002, 'Juan', 'Fernandez', 'juanf@example.com', NULL,
   TO_DATE('04-OCT-1992', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), 'SH_CLERK', 3000,
   NULL, 121, 20);
```
**Inserting Sequence Values: Example**
The following statement inserts a new row containing the next value of the `departments_seq` sequence into the `departments` table:
```
INSERT INTO departments
   VALUES  (departments_seq.nextval, 'Entertainment', 162, 1400);
```
**Inserting Using Bind Variables: Example**
The following example returns the values of the inserted rows into output bind variables :`bnd1` and :`bnd2`. The bind variables must first be declared.

INSERT INTO employees
      (employee_id, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id, salary)
   VALUES
   (employees_seq.nextval, 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com',

**Inserting into a Substitutable Tables and Columns: Examples**
The following example inserts into the `persons` table, which is created in “Substitutable Table and Column Examples”. The first statement uses the root type `person_t`. The second insert uses the `employee_t` subtype of `person_t`, and the third insert uses the `part_time_emp_t` subtype of `employee_t`:
```
INSERT INTO persons VALUES (person_t('Bob', 1234));
INSERT INTO persons VALUES (employee_t('Joe', 32456, 12, 100000));
INSERT INTO persons VALUES (
   part_time_emp_t('Tim', 5678, 13, 1000, 20));
```
The following example inserts into the `books` table, which was created in “Substitutable Table and Column Examples”. Notice that specification of the attribute values is identical to that for the substitutable table example:
```
INSERT INTO books VALUES (
   'An Autobiography', person_t('Bob', 1234));
INSERT INTO books VALUES (
   'Business Rules', employee_t('Joe', 3456, 12, 10000));
INSERT INTO books VALUES (
   'Mixing School and Work',
   part_time_emp_t('Tim', 5678, 13, 1000, 20));
```
You can extract data from substitutable tables and columns using built-in functions and conditions. For examples, see the functions TREAT and SYS_TYPEID, and “IS OF type Condition”.
**Inserting Using the TO_LOB Function: Example**
The following example copies `LONG` data to a LOB column in the following `long_tab` table:
```
CREATE TABLE long_tab (pic_id NUMBER, long_pics LONG RAW);
```
First you must create a table with a LOB.
```
CREATE TABLE lob_tab (pic_id NUMBER, lob_pics BLOB);
```
Next, use an `INSERT` … `SELECT` statement to copy the data in all rows for the `LONG` column into the newly created LOB column:
```
INSERT INTO lob_tab
   SELECT pic_id, TO_LOB(long_pics) FROM long_tab;
```
When you are confident that the migration has been successful, you can drop the `long_pics` table. Alternatively, if the table contains other columns, then you can simply drop the `LONG` column from the table as follows:
```
ALTER TABLE long_tab DROP COLUMN long_pics;
```
**Multitable Inserts: Examples**
The following example uses the multitable insert syntax to insert into the sample table `sh.sales` some data from an input table with a different structure.
  **Note:**   A number of `NOT` `NULL` constraints on the `sales` table have been disabled for purposes of this example, because the example ignores a number of table columns for the sake of brevity.
The input table looks like this:
```
SELECT * FROM sales_input_table;
```
```
PRODUCT_ID CUSTOMER_ID WEEKLY_ST  SALES_SUN  SALES_MON  SALES_TUE  SALES_WED SALES_THU  SALES_FRI  SALES_SAT
---------- ----------- --------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------------------- ---------- ----------
       111         222 01-OCT-00        100        200        300        400       500        600        700
       222         333 08-OCT-00        200        300        400        500       600        700        800
       333         444 15-OCT-00        300        400        500        600       700        800        900
```
```
```
The multitable insert statement looks like this:
```
INSERT ALL
      INTO sales (prod_id, cust_id, time_id, amount)
      VALUES (product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date, sales_sun)
      INTO sales (prod_id, cust_id, time_id, amount)
      VALUES (product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date+1, sales_mon)
      INTO sales (prod_id, cust_id, time_id, amount)
      VALUES (product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date+2, sales_tue)
      INTO sales (prod_id, cust_id, time_id, amount)
      VALUES (product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date+3, sales_wed)
      INTO sales (prod_id, cust_id, time_id, amount)
      VALUES (product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date+4, sales_thu)
      INTO sales (prod_id, cust_id, time_id, amount)
      VALUES (product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date+5, sales_fri)
      INTO sales (prod_id, cust_id, time_id, amount)
      VALUES (product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date+6, sales_sat)
   SELECT product_id, customer_id, weekly_start_date, sales_sun,
      sales_mon, sales_tue, sales_wed, sales_thu, sales_fri, sales_sat
      FROM sales_input_table;
```
Assuming these are the only rows in the `sales` table, the contents now look like this:
```
SELECT * FROM sales
   ORDER BY prod_id, cust_id, time_id;
   PROD_ID    CUST_ID TIME_ID   C   PROMO_ID QUANTITY_SOLD     AMOUNT       COST

       333        444 21-OCT-00                                   900
```
The next examples insert into multiple tables. Suppose you want to provide to sales representatives some information on orders of various sizes. The following example creates tables for small, medium, large, and special orders and populates those tables with data from the sample table `oe.orders`:
```
CREATE TABLE small_orders
   (order_id       NUMBER(12)   NOT NULL,
    customer_id    NUMBER(6)    NOT NULL,
    order_total    NUMBER(8,2),
    sales_rep_id   NUMBER(6)
   );
CREATE TABLE medium_orders AS SELECT * FROM small_orders;
CREATE TABLE large_orders AS SELECT * FROM small_orders;
CREATE TABLE special_orders
   (order_id       NUMBER(12)    NOT NULL,
    customer_id    NUMBER(6)     NOT NULL,
    order_total    NUMBER(8,2),
    sales_rep_id   NUMBER(6),
    credit_limit   NUMBER(9,2),
    cust_email     VARCHAR2(40)
   );
```
The first multitable insert populates only the tables for small, medium, and large orders:
```
INSERT ALL
   WHEN order_total <= 100000 THEN
      INTO small_orders
   WHEN order_total > 1000000 AND order_total <= 200000 THEN
      INTO medium_orders
   WHEN order_total > 200000 THEN
      INTO large_orders
   SELECT order_id, order_total, sales_rep_id, customer_id
      FROM orders;
```
You can accomplish the same thing using the `ELSE` clause in place of the insert into the `large_orders` table:
```
INSERT ALL
   WHEN order_total <= 100000 THEN
      INTO small_orders
   WHEN order_total > 100000 AND order_total <= 200000 THEN
      INTO medium_orders
   ELSE
      INTO large_orders
   SELECT order_id, order_total, sales_rep_id, customer_id
      FROM orders;
```
The next example inserts into the small, medium, and large tables, as in the preceding example, and also puts orders greater than 290,000 into the `special_orders` table. This table also shows how to use column aliases to simplify the statement:
```
INSERT ALL
   WHEN ottl <= 100000 THEN
      INTO small_orders
         VALUES(oid, ottl, sid, cid)
   WHEN ottl > 100000 and ottl <= 200000 THEN
      INTO medium_orders
         VALUES(oid, ottl, sid, cid)
   WHEN ottl > 200000 THEN
      into large_orders
         VALUES(oid, ottl, sid, cid)
   WHEN ottl > 290000 THEN
      INTO special_orders
   SELECT o.order_id oid, o.customer_id cid, o.order_total ottl,
      o.sales_rep_id sid, c.credit_limit cl, c.cust_email cem
      FROM orders o, customers c
      WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```
Finally, the next example uses the `FIRST` clause to put orders greater than 290,000 into the `special_orders` table and exclude those orders from the `large_orders` table:
```
INSERT FIRST
   WHEN ottl <= 100000 THEN
      INTO small_orders
         VALUES(oid, ottl, sid, cid)
   WHEN ottl > 100000 and ottl <= 200000 THEN
      INTO medium_orders
         VALUES(oid, ottl, sid, cid)
   WHEN ottl > 290000 THEN
      INTO special_orders
   WHEN ottl > 200000 THEN
      INTO large_orders
         VALUES(oid, ottl, sid, cid)
   SELECT o.order_id oid, o.customer_id cid, o.order_total ottl,
      o.sales_rep_id sid, c.credit_limit cl, c.cust_email cem
      FROM orders o, customers c
      WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```
**Inserting Multiple Rows Using a Single Statement: Example**
The following statements create three tables named people, patients and staff:
```
CREATE TABLE people (
  person_id   INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  given_name  VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  family_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  title       VARCHAR2(20),
  birth_date  DATE
);
CREATE TABLE patients (
  patient_id          INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES people (person_id),
  last_admission_date DATE
);
CREATE TABLE staff (
  staff_id   INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES people (person_id),
  hired_date DATE
);
```
The following statement inserts a row into the people table:
```
INSERT INTO people
VALUES (1, 'Dave', 'Badger', 'Mr', date'1960-05-01');
```
The following statement returns an error as there is no value provided for the birth_date column:
```
INSERT INTO people
VALUES (2, 'Simon', 'Fox', 'Mr');
```
The following statement inserts a row into the people table:
```
INSERT INTO people (person_id, given_name, family_name, title)
VALUES (2, 'Simon', 'Fox', 'Mr');
```
The following statement inserts a row into the people table and the value for the title column is populated by selecting a static value from the dual table:
```
INSERT INTO people (person_id, given_name, family_name, title)
VALUES (3, 'Dave', 'Frog', (SELECT 'Mr' FROM dual));
```
The following statement inserts multiple rows into the people table using ‘SELECT’ statement:
```
INSERT INTO people (person_id, given_name, family_name, title)
  WITH names AS (
    SELECT 4, 'Ruth',     'Fox',      'Mrs'    FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 5, 'Isabelle', 'Squirrel', 'Miss'   FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 6, 'Justin',   'Frog',     'Master' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 7, 'Lisa',     'Owl',      'Dr'     FROM dual
  )
  SELECT * FROM names;
```
The following statement rolls back all the previous DML operations:
```
ROLLBACK;
```
The following statement inserts multiple rows into the people table using ‘SELECT’ statement with a ‘WHERE’ condition:
```
INSERT INTO people (person_id, given_name, family_name, title)
  WITH names AS (
    SELECT 4, 'Ruth',     'Fox' family_name,      'Mrs'    FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 5, 'Isabelle', 'Squirrel' family_name, 'Miss'   FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 6, 'Justin',   'Frog' family_name,     'Master' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 7, 'Lisa',     'Owl' family_name,      'Dr'     FROM dual
  )
  SELECT * FROM names
  WHERE  family_name LIKE 'F%';
```
The following statement rolls back all the previous DML operations:
```
ROLLBACK;
```
The following statement inserts multiple rows into people, patients and staff table using ‘INSERT ALL’ statement:
```
INSERT ALL
  /* Every one is a person */
  INTO people (person_id, given_name, family_name, title)
    VALUES (id, given_name, family_name, title)
  INTO patients (patient_id, last_admission_date)
    VALUES (id, admission_date)
  INTO staff (staff_id, hired_date)
    VALUES (id, hired_date)
  WITH names AS (
    SELECT 4 id, 'Ruth' given_name, 'Fox' family_name, 'Mrs' title,
           NULL hired_date, DATE'2009-12-31' admission_date
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 5 id, 'Isabelle' given_name, 'Squirrel' family_name, 'Miss' title ,
           NULL hired_date, DATE'2014-01-01' admission_date
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 6 id, 'Justin' given_name, 'Frog' family_name, 'Master' title,
           NULL hired_date, DATE'2015-04-22' admission_date
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 7 id, 'Lisa' given_name, 'Owl' family_name, 'Dr' title,
           DATE'2015-01-01' hired_date, NULL admission_date
    FROM   dual
  )
  SELECT * FROM names;
```
The following statement rolls back all the previous DML operations:
```
ROLLBACK;
```
The following statement inserts multiple rows into people, patients and staff table using ‘INSERT ALL’ statement with various conditions:
```
INSERT ALL
  /* Everyone is a person, so insert all rows into people */
  WHEN 1=1 THEN
    INTO people (person_id, given_name, family_name, title)
    VALUES (id, given_name, family_name, title)
  /* Only people with an admission date are patients */
  WHEN admission_date IS NOT NULL THEN
    INTO patients (patient_id, last_admission_date)
    VALUES (id, admission_date)
  /* Only people with a hired date are staff */
  WHEN hired_date IS NOT NULL THEN
    INTO staff (staff_id, hired_date)
    VALUES (id, hired_date)
  WITH names AS (
    SELECT 4 id, 'Ruth' given_name, 'Fox' family_name, 'Mrs' title,
           NULL hired_date, DATE'2009-12-31' admission_date
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 5 id, 'Isabelle' given_name, 'Squirrel' family_name, 'Miss' title ,
           NULL hired_date, DATE'2014-01-01' admission_date
    FROM   dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 6 id, 'Justin' given_name, 'Frog' family_name, 'Master' title,
           NULL hired_date, DATE'2015-04-22' admission_date
