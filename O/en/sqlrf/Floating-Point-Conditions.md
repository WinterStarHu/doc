# Floating-Point Conditions

The floating-point conditions let you determine whether an expression is infinite or is the undefined result of an operation (is not a number or `NaN`).

In both forms of floating-point condition, *expr* must resolve to a numeric data type or to any data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. Table 6-3 describes the floating-point conditions.
Table 3 Floating-Point Conditions
| Type of Condition | Operation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| IS [NOT] NAN | Returns TRUE if expr is the special value NaN when NOT is not specified. Returns TRUE if expr is not the special value NaN when NOT is specified. | SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE commission_pct IS NOT NAN; |
| IS [NOT] INFINITE | Returns TRUE if expr is the special value +INF or -INF when NOT is not specified. Returns TRUE if expr is neither +INF nor -INF when NOT is specified. | SELECT last_name FROM employees WHERE salary IS NOT INFINITE; |
