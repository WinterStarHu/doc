# Creating and Managing Tables

Tables are the basic units of data storage in Oracle Database. Tables hold all user-accessible data. Each table contains rows that represent individual data records. Rows are composed of columns that represent the fields of the records.
**Note:**   To do the tutorials in this document, you must be connected to Oracle Database as the user HR from SQL Developer.

## About SQL Data Types
When you create a table, you must specify the SQL data type for each column, which determines what values the column can contain.
For example, a column of type DATE can contain the value `'01-MAY-05'`, but it cannot contain the numeric value 2 or the character value ‘shoe’. SQL data types fall into two categories: built-in and user-defined. (PL/SQL has additional data types-see “About PL/SQL Data Types”.)
**See Also:**

- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for a summary of built-in SQL data types
**
- Oracle Database Concepts for introductions to each of the built-in SQL data types
**
- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for more information about user-defined data types
- “About PL/SQL Data Types”
## Creating Tables
To create tables, use either the SQL Developer tool Create Table or the DDL statement CREATE TABLE.
This section shows how to use both of these ways to create these tables, which will contain data about employee evaluations:
- PERFORMANCE_PARTS, which contains the categories of employee performance that are evaluated and their relative weights
- EVALUATIONS, which contains employee information, evaluation date, job, manager, and department
- SCORES, which contains the scores assigned to each performance category for each evaluation
These tables appear in many tutorials and examples in this document.
### Tutorial: Creating a Table with the Create Table Tool
This tutorial shows how to create the `PERFORMANCE_PARTS` table using the SQL Developer tool Create Table.
**To create the PERFORMANCE_PARTS table using the Create Table tool:**
****
- In the Connections frame, expand hr_conn.
****
- In the list of schema object types, right-click Tables.
****
- In the list of choices, click New Table. The Create Table window opens, with default values for a new table, which has only one row.
- For Schema, accept the default value, HR.
- For Name, enter PERFORMANCE_PARTS.
  - For PK (primary key), accept the default option, deselected.
  - For Column Name, enter PERFORMANCE_ID.
  - For Type, accept the default value, VARCHAR2.
  - For Size, enter 2.
  - For Not Null, accept the default option, deselected.
****
- Click Add Column.
- For Column Name, enter NAME.
- For Type, accept the default value, VARCHAR2.
- For Size, enter 80.
****
- Click Add Column.
- For Column Name, enter WEIGHT.
- For Type, select NUMBER from the menu.
****
****
- Click OK. The table PERFORMANCE_PARTS is created. Its name appears under Tables in the Connections frame. To see the CREATE TABLE statement for creating this table, select PERFORMANCE_PARTS and click the tab SQL.
**See Also:**   *Oracle SQL Developer User’s Guide* for more information about using SQL Developer to create tables
### Creating Tables with the CREATE TABLE Statement
This section shows how to use the CREATE TABLE statement to create the EVALUATIONS and SCORES tables.
The CREATE TABLE statement in Example 4-1 creates the EVALUATIONS table.
The CREATE TABLE statement in Example 4-2 creates the SCORES table.
In SQL Developer, in the Connections frame, if you expand Tables, you can see the tables EVALUATIONS and SCORES.
**Example 4-1 Creating the EVALUATIONS Table with CREATE TABLE**
```
CREATE TABLE EVALUATIONS (
  EVALUATION_ID    NUMBER(8,0),
  EMPLOYEE_ID      NUMBER(6,0),
  EVALUATION_DATE  DATE,
  JOB_ID           VARCHAR2(10),
  MANAGER_ID       NUMBER(6,0),
  DEPARTMENT_ID    NUMBER(4,0),
  TOTAL_SCORE      NUMBER(3,0)
);
```
Result:
```
Table created.
```
**Example 4-2 Creating the SCORES Table with CREATE TABLE**
```
CREATE TABLE SCORES (
  EVALUATION_ID   NUMBER(8,0),
  PERFORMANCE_ID  VARCHAR2(2),
  SCORE           NUMBER(1,0)
);
```
Result:
```
Table created.
```
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database SQL Language Reference* for information about the CREATE TABLE statement
## Ensuring Data Integrity in Tables
To ensure that the data in your tables satisfies the business rules that your application models, you can use constraints, application logic, or both.
**Tip:**    Wherever possible, use constraints instead of application logic. Oracle Database checks that all data obeys constraints much faster than application logic can.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database Concepts for additional general information about data integrity
**
- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for syntactic information about constraints
**
- Oracle Database Development Guide for information about enabling and disabling constraints
### About Constraints
**Constraints** restrict the values that columns can have. Trying to change the data in a way that violates a constraint causes an error and rolls back the change. Trying to add a constraint to a populated table causes an error if existing data violates the constraint.
Constraints can be enabled and disabled. By default, they are created in the enabled state.
The following types of constraints are available:
****
- Not Null, which prevents a value from being null In the EMPLOYEES table, the column LAST_NAME has the NOT NULL constraint, which enforces the business rule that every employee must have a last name.
****
- Unique, which prevents multiple rows from having the same value in the same column or combination of columns, but allows some values to be null In the EMPLOYEES table, the column EMAIL has the UNIQUE constraint, which enforces the business rule that an employee can have no email address, but cannot have the same email address as another employee.
- Primary Key, which is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE In the EMPLOYEES table, the column EMPLOYEE_ID has the PRIMARY KEY constraint, which enforces the business rule that every employee must have a unique employee identification number.
****
- Foreign Key, which requires values in one table to match values in another table In the EMPLOYEES table, the column JOB_ID has a FOREIGN KEY constraint that references the JOBS table, which enforces the business rule that an employee cannot have a JOB_ID that is not in the JOBS table.
****
****
- Check, which requires that a value satisfy a specified condition The EMPLOYEES table does not have CHECK constraints. However, suppose that EMPLOYEES needs a new column, EMPLOYEE_AGE, and that every employee must be at least 18. The constraint CHECK (EMPLOYEE_AGE >= 18) enforces the business rule. Tip: Use check constraints only when other constraint types cannot provide the necessary checking.
**
- REF, which further describes the relationship between a REF column and the object that it references A REF column references an object in another object type or in a relational table. For information about REF constraints, see Oracle Database Concepts.
**See Also:**
    **- Oracle Database SQL Language Reference for syntactic information about constraints
### Tutorial: Adding Constraints to Existing Tables
This tutorial shows how to add constraints to existing tables using both SQL Developer tools and the ALTER TABLE statement.
To add constraints to existing tables, use either SQL Developer tools or the DDL statement ALTER TABLE. This topic shows how to use both of these ways to add constraints to the tables created in “Creating Tables”.
This tutorial has several procedures. The first procedure uses the Edit Table tool to add a Not Null constraint to the `NAMES` column of the `PERFORMANCE_PARTS` table. The remaining procedures show how to use other tools to add constraints; however, you could add the same constraints using the Edit Table tool.

## Managing Indexes
You can create indexes on one or more columns of a table to speed SQL statement execution on that table. When properly used, indexes are the primary means of reducing disk input/output (I/O).
When you define a primary key on a table:
- If an existing index starts with the primary key columns, then Oracle Database uses that existing index for the primary key. The existing index need not be Unique. For example, if you define the primary key (A, B), Oracle Database uses the existing index (A, B, C).
- If no existing index starts with the primary key columns and the constraint is immediate, then Oracle Database creates a Unique index on the primary key.
- If no existing index starts with the primary key columns and the constraint is deferrable, then Oracle Database creates a non-Unique index on the primary key.
For example, in “Tutorial: Adding Constraints to Existing Tables”, you added a Primary Key constraint to the EVALUATION_ID column of the EVALUATIONS table. Therefore, if you select the EVALUATIONS table in the SQL Developer Connections frame and click the Indexes tab, the Indexes pane shows a Unique index on the EVALUATION_ID column.
