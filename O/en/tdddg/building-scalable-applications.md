# Building Scalable Applications

Design your applications to use the same resources, regardless of user populations and data volumes, and not to overload system resources.
## About Scalable Applications
A **scalable** application can process a larger workload with a proportional increase in system resource usage.
A **scalable** application can process a larger workload with a proportional increase in system resource usage. For example, if you double its workload, a scalable application uses twice as many system resources.
An **unscalable** application exhausts a system resource; therefore, if you increase the application workload, no more throughput is possible. Unscalable applications result in fixed throughputs and poor response times.
Examples of resource exhaustion are:
- Hardware exhaustion
- Table scans in high-volume transactions causing inevitable disk input/output (I/O) shortages
- Excessive network requests causing network and scheduling bottlenecks
- Memory allocation causing paging and swapping
- Excessive process and thread allocation causing operating system thrashing
Design your applications to use the same resources, regardless of user populations and data volumes, and not to overload system resources.
## Using Bind Variables to Improve Scalability
Bind variables, used correctly, let you develop efficient, scalable applications.
A **bind variable** is a placeholder in a SQL statement that must be replaced with a valid value or value address for the statement to execute successfully. By using bind variables, you can write a SQL statement that accepts inputs or parameters at run time.
Just as a subprogram can have parameters, whose values are supplied by the invoker, a SQL statement can have bind variable placeholders, whose values (called bind variables) are supplied at runtime. Just as a subprogram is compiled once and then run many times with different parameters, a SQL statement with bind variable placeholders is hard parsed once and then soft parsed with different bind variables.
A **hard parse** , which includes optimization and row source generation, is a very CPU-intensive operation. A **soft parse** , which skips optimization and row source generation and proceeds straight to execution, is usually much faster than a hard parse of the same statement. (For an overview of SQL processing, which includes the difference between a hard and soft parse, see *Oracle Database Concepts*.)
Not only is a hard parse a CPU-intensive operation, it is an unscalable operation, because it cannot be done concurrently with many other operations. For more information about concurrency and scalability, see “About Concurrency and Scalability”.
Example 8-1 shows the performance difference between a query without a bind variable and a semantically equivalent query with a bind variable. The former is slower and uses many more latches (for information about how latches affect scalability, see). To collect and display performance statistics, the example uses the Runstats tool, described in “Comparing Programming Techniques with Runstats”.
**Note:**
**
- Example 8-1 shows the performance cost for a single user. As more users are added, the cost escalates rapidly.
```
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON FORMAT TRUNCATED
```
- The result of Example 8-1 was produced with this setting:
**Note:**
**
- Using bind variables instead of string literals is the most effective way to make your code invulnerable to SQL injection attacks. For details, see Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference.
**
- Bind variables sometimes reduce the efficiency of data warehousing systems. Because most queries take so long, the optimizer tries to produce the best plan for each query rather than the best generic query. Using bind variables sometimes forces the optimizer to produce the best generic query. For information about improving performance in data warehousing systems, see Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide.
Although soft parsing is more efficient than hard parsing, the cost of soft parsing a statement many times is still very high. To maximize the efficiency and scalability of your application, minimize parsing. The easiest way to minimize parsing is to use PL/SQL.
**Example 8-1 Bind Variable Improves Performance**
```
CREATE TABLE t ( x VARCHAR2(5) );
DECLARE
  TYPE rc IS REF CURSOR;
  l_cursor rc;
BEGIN
  runstats_pkg.rs_start;  -- Collect statistics for query without bind variable
  FOR i IN 1 .. 5000 LOOP
    OPEN l_cursor FOR 'SELECT x FROM t WHERE x = ' || TO_CHAR(i);
    CLOSE l_cursor;
  END LOOP;
  runstats_pkg.rs_middle;  -- Collect statistics for query with bind variable
  FOR i IN 1 .. 5000 LOOP
    OPEN l_cursor FOR 'SELECT x FROM t WHERE x = :x' USING i;
    CLOSE l_cursor;
  END LOOP;
  runstats_pkg.rs_stop(500);  -- Stop collecting statistics
end;
/
```
The result is similar to the following text:

## Using PL/SQL to Improve Scalability
Certain PL/SQL features can help you to improve application scalability.
### How PL/SQL Minimizes Parsing
PL/SQL, which is optimized for database access, silently caches statements. In PL/SQL, when you close a cursor, the cursor closes from your perspective-that is, you cannot use it where an open cursor is required-but PL/SQL actually keeps the cursor open and caches its statement.
If you use the cached statement again, PL/SQL uses the same cursor, thereby avoiding a parse. (PL/SQL closes cached statements if necessary-for example, if your program must open another cursor but doing so would exceed the init.ora setting of OPEN_CURSORS.)
PL/SQL can silently cache only SQL statements that cannot change at runtime.
### About the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE Statement
The EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement builds and runs a dynamic SQL statement in a single operation.
The basic syntax of the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement is:
```
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_statement
```
sql_statement is a string that represents a SQL statement. If sql_statement has the same value every time the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement runs, then PL/SQL can cache the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement. If sql_statement can be different every time the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement runs, then PL/SQL cannot cache the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference for information about EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
- “About the DBMS_SQL Package”
### About OPEN FOR Statements
The OPEN FOR statement has the following basic syntax.
The basic syntax of the OPEN FOR statement is:
```
OPEN cursor_variable FOR query
```
Your application can open cursor_variable for several different queries before closing it. Because PL/SQL cannot determine the number of different queries until runtime, PL/SQL cannot cache the OPEN FOR statement.
If you do not need to use a cursor variable, then use a declared cursor, for both better performance and ease of programming. For details, see *Oracle Database Development Guide*.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference for information about OPEN FOR
- “About Cursor Variables”
- “About Cursors”
### About the DBMS_SQL Package
The DBMS_SQL package is an API for building, running, and describing dynamic SQL statements. You must use the DBMS_SQL package instead of the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement if the PL/SQL compiler cannot determine at compile time the number or types of output host variables (select list items) or input bind variables.
The DBMS_SQL package is an API for building, running, and describing dynamic SQL statements. Using the DBMS_SQL package takes more effort than using the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement, but you must use the DBMS_SQL package if the PL/SQL compiler cannot determine at compile time the number or types of output host variables (select list items) or input bind variables.

### About Bulk SQL
Bulk SQL reduces the number of “round trips” between PL/SQL and SQL, thereby using fewer resources.
Without bulk SQL, you retrieve one row at a time from the database (SQL), process it (PL/SQL), and return it to the database (SQL). With bulk SQL, you retrieve a set of rows from the database, process the set of rows, and then return the whole set to the database.
Oracle recommends using Bulk SQL when you retrieve multiple rows from the database *and* return them to the database, as in Example 8-2. You do not need bulk SQL if you retrieve multiple rows but do not return them; for example:
```
FOR x IN (SELECT * FROM t WHERE ... )  -- Retrieve row set (implicit array fetch)
  LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(t.x);          -- Process rows but do not return them
  END LOOP;
```
Example 8-2 loops through a table t with a column object_name, retrieving sets of 100 rows, processing them, and returning them to the database. (Limiting the bulk FETCH statement to 100 rows requires an explicit cursor.)
Example 8-3 does the same job as Example 8-2, without bulk SQL.
As these TKPROF reports for Example 8-2 and Example 8-3 show, using bulk SQL for this job uses almost 50% less CPU time:

## About Concurrency and Scalability
**Concurrency** is the simultaneous execution of multiple transactions. The better your application handles concurrency, the more scalable it is. A **scalable** application can process a larger workload with a proportional increase in system resource usage.
**Concurrency** is the simultaneous execution of multiple transactions. Statements within concurrent transactions can update the same data. The better your application handles concurrency, the more scalable it is. A **scalable** application can process a larger workload with a proportional increase in system resource usage. For example, if you double its workload, a scalable application uses twice as many system resources.
Concurrent transactions must produce meaningful and consistent results. Therefore, a multiuser database must provide the following:
****
- Data concurrency , which ensures that users can access data at the same time.
****
- Data consistency, which ensures that each user sees a consistent view of the data, including visible changes from his or her own transactions and committed transactions of other users
Oracle Database maintains data consistency by using a multiversion consistency model and various types of locks and transaction isolation levels. For an overview of the Oracle Database locking mechanism, see *Oracle Database Concepts*. For an overview of Oracle Database transaction isolation levels, see *Oracle Database Concepts*.
To describe consistent transaction behavior when transactions run concurrently, database researchers have defined a transaction isolation category called **serializable**. A **serializable transaction** operates in an environment that appears to be a single-user database. Serializable transactions are desirable in specific cases, but for 99% of the work load, read committed isolation is perfect.
Oracle Database has features that improve concurrency and scalability-for example, sequences, latches, nonblocking reads and writes, and shared SQL.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Concepts* for more information about data concurrency and consistency
### About Sequences and Concurrency
Sequences eliminate serialization, thereby improving the concurrency and scalability of your application.
A **sequence** is a schema object from which multiple users can generate unique integers, which is very useful when you need unique primary keys.
Without sequences, unique primary key values must be produced programmatically. A user gets a new primary key value by selecting the most recently produced value and incrementing it. This technique requires a lock during the transaction and causes multiple users to wait for the next primary key value-that is, the transactions serialize. Sequences eliminate serialization, thereby improving the concurrency and scalability of your application.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database Concepts for information about concurrent access to sequences
- “Creating and Managing Sequences”
### About Latches and Concurrency
An increase in latches means more concurrency-based waits, and therefore a decrease in scalability.
A **latch** is a simple, low-level serialization mechanism that coordinates multiuser access to shared data structures. Latches protect shared memory resources from corruption when accessed by multiple processes.
An increase in latches means more concurrency-based waits, and therefore a decrease in scalability. If you can use either an approach that runs slightly faster during development or one that uses fewer latches, use the latter.
**See Also:**
**
- Oracle Database Concepts for information about latches
**
- Oracle Database Concepts for information about mutexes, which are like latches for single objects
### About Nonblocking Reads and Writes and Concurrency
In Oracle Database, **nonblocking reads and writes** let queries execute concurrently with changes to the data they are reading, without blocking or stopping. Nonblocking reads and writes let one session read data while another session is changing that data.
### About Shared SQL and Concurrency
Oracle Database compiles a SQL statement into an executable object once, and then other sessions can reuse the object for as long as it exists. This Oracle Database feature, called **shared SQL** , lets the database do very resource-intensive operations-compiling and optimizing SQL statements-only once, instead of every time a session uses the same SQL statement.
**See Also:**   *Oracle Database Concepts* for more information about shared SQL
## Limiting the Number of Concurrent Sessions
The more concurrent sessions you have, the more concurrency-based waits you have, and the slower your response time is.
If your computer has *n* CPU cores, then at most *n* sessions can really be concurrently active. Each additional “concurrent” session must wait for a CPU core to be available before it can become active. If some waiting sessions are waiting only for I/O, then increasing the number of concurrent sessions to slightly more than *n* might slightly improve runtime performance. However, increasing the number of concurrent sessions too much will significantly reduce runtime performance.
The SESSIONS initialization parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent users in the system. For details, see *Oracle Database Reference*.
**See Also:**   `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNDnVOCdvQ0` for a video that shows the effect of reducing the number of concurrent sessions on a computer with 12 CPU cores from thousands to 96
## Comparing Programming Techniques with Runstats
The Runstats tool lets you compare the performance of two programming techniques to see which is better.
### About Runstats
The Runstats tool lets you compare the performance of two programming techniques to see which is better.
Runstats measures the following values:
- Elapsed time for each technique in hundredths of seconds (hsec)
- Elapsed time for the first technique as a percentage of that of the second technique
- System statistics for the two techniques (for example, parse calls)
- Latching for the two techniques
Of the preceding measurements, the most important is latching (see “About Latches and Concurrency”).
**See Also:**   Example 8-1, which uses Runstats
### Setting Up Runstats
The Runstats tool is implemented as a package that uses a view and a temporary table.
**Note:**   For step 1 of the following procedure, you need the SELECT privilege on the dynamic performance views V$STATNAME, V$MYSTAT, and V$LATCH. If you cannot get this privilege, then have someone who has the privilege create the view in step 1 and grant you the SELECT privilege on it.
**Steps to set up the Runstats tool:**
```
 CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW stats
 AS SELECT 'STAT...' || a.name name, b.value
 FROM V$STATNAME a, V$MYSTAT b
 WHERE a.statistic# = b.statistic#
 UNION ALL
 SELECT 'LATCH.' || name, gets
 FROM V$LATCH;
```
- Create the view that Runstats uses:
```
 DROP TABLE run_stats;
 CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE run_stats
 ( runid VARCHAR2(15),
   name VARCHAR2(80),
   value INT )
 ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;
```
- Create the temporary table that Runstats uses:
```
 CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE runstats_pkg
 AS
   PROCEDURE rs_start;
   PROCEDURE rs_middle;
   PROCEDURE rs_stop( p_difference_threshold IN NUMBER DEFAULT 0 );
 end;
 /
```
********
- Create this package specification: The parameter p_difference_threshold controls the amount of statistics and latching data that Runstats displays. Runstats displays data only when the difference for the two techniques is greater than p_difference_threshold. By default, Runstats displays all data.
```
 CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY runstats_pkg
 AS
   g_start NUMBER;
   g_run1 NUMBER;
   g_run2 NUMBER;
   PROCEDURE rs_start
   IS
   BEGIN
     DELETE FROM run_stats;
     INSERT INTO run_stats

### Using Runstats
This topic gives the syntax for using the Runstats tool.
To use Runstats to compare two programming techniques, invoke the runstats_pkg procedures from an anonymous block, using this syntax:
```
[ DECLARE local_declarations ]
BEGIN
  runstats_pkg.rs_start;
  code_for_first_technique
  runstats_pkg.rs_middle;
  code_for_second_technique
  runstats_pkg.rs_stop(n);
END;
/
```

## Real-World Performance and Data Processing Techniques
A common task in database applications in a data warehouse environment is querying or modifying a huge data set. The problem for application developers is how to achieve high performance when processing large data sets.
Processing techniques fall into two categories: iterative, and set-based. Over years of testing, the Real-World Performance group has discovered that **set-based processing techniques perform orders of magnitude better** for database applications that process large data sets.
This topic includes the following major subtopics:.
### About Iterative Data Processing
In iterative processing, applications use conditional logic to loop through a set of rows.
Typically, although not necessarily, iterative processing uses a client/server model as follows:
- Transfer a group of rows from the database server to the client application.
- Process the group within the client application.
- Transfer the processed group back to the database server.
You can implement iterative algorithms using three main techniques: row-by-row processing, array processing, and manual parallelism.
**Iterative Processing: Row-By-Row**
In row-by-row processing, a single process loops through a data set and operates on a single row a time. In a typical implementation, the application retrieves each row from the database, processes it in the middle tier, and then sends the row back to the database, which executes DML and commits.
Assume that your functional requirement is to query an external table named ext_scan_events, and then insert its rows into a heap-organized staging table named stage1_scan_events. The following PL/SQL block uses a row-by-row technique to meet this requirement:
```
declare
  cursor c is select s.* from ext_scan_events s;
  r c%rowtype;
begin
  open c;
  loop
    fetch c into r;
    exit when c%notfound;
    insert into stage1_scan_events d values r;
    commit;
  end loop;
  close c;
end;
```
The row-by-row technique has the following advantages:
- It performs well on small data sets.
- The looping algorithm is familiar to all professional developers, easy to write quickly, and easy to understand.
The row-by-row technique has the following disadvantages:
- Processing time can be unacceptably long for large data sets.
- The application executes serially, and thus cannot exploit the native parallel processing features of Oracle Database running on modern hardware.
See Also: RWP #7 Set-Based Processing
**Iterative Processing: Arrays**
Array processing is identical to row-by-row processing, except that it processes a group of rows in each iteration rather than a single row.
Assume that your functional requirement is the same as in Example X-X: query an external table named ext_scan_events, and then insert its rows into a heap-organized staging table named stage1_scan_events. The following PL/SQL block uses an array technique to meet this requirement:
```
declare
  cursor c is select s.* from ext_scan_events s;
  type t is table of c%rowtype index by binary_integer;
  a t;
  rows binary_integer := 0;
begin
  open c;
  loop
    fetch c bulk collect into a limit array_size;
    exit when a.count = 0;
    forall i in 1..a.count
      insert into stage1_scan_events d values a(i);
    commit;
  end loop;
  close c;
end;
```
The preceding code differs from the equivalent row-by-row code in using a BULK COLLECT operator in the FETCH STATEMENT, which is limited by the `array_size` value of type PLS_INTEGER. For example, if `array_size` is set to 100, then the application fetches rows in groups of 100.
The array technique has the following advantages over the row-by-row technique:
- The array enables the application to process a group of rows at the same time, which means that it reduces network round trips, COMMIT time, and the code path in the client and server.
- The database is more efficient because the server process batches the inserts, and commits after every group of inserts rather than after every insert.
The disadvantages of this technique are the same as for row-by-row processing. Processing time can be unacceptable for large data sets. Also, the application must run serially on a single CPU core, and thus cannot exploit the native parallelism of Oracle Database.
**Iterative Processing: Manual Parallelism**
Manual parallelism uses the same iterative algorithm as row-by-row and array processing, but enables multiple server processes to divide the work and run in parallel.
Assume the functional requirement is the same as in the row-by-row and array examples. The primary differences are as follows:
- The scan event records are stored in a mass of flat files.
- 32 server processes must run in parallel, with each server process querying a different external table.
- You use PL/SQL to achieve the parallelism by executing 32 threads of the same PL/SQL program, with each thread running simultaneously as a separate job managed by Oracle Scheduler. A job is the combination of a schedule and a program.
The following PL/SQL code uses manual parallellism:
```
declare
  sqlstmt varchar2(1024) := q'[
-- BEGIN embedded anonymous block
  cursor c is select s.* from ext_scan_events_${thr} s;
  type t is table of c%rowtype index by binary_integer;
  a t;
  rows binary_integer := 0;
begin
  for r in (select ext_file_name from ext_scan_events_dets where ora_hash(file_seq_nbr,${thrs}) = ${thr})
  loop
    execute immediate
      'alter table ext_scan_events_${thr} location' || '(' || r.ext_file_name || ')';
    open c;
    loop
      fetch c bulk collect into a limit ${array_size};
      exit when a.count = 0;
      forall i in 1..a.count
        insert into stage1_scan_events d values a(i);
      commit;
--  demo instrumentation
      rows := rows + a.count; if rows > 1e3 then exit when not sd_control.p_progress('loading','userdefined',rows); rows := 0; end if;
    end loop;
    close c;
  end loop;
end;
-- END   embedded anonymous block
]';
begin
  sqlstmt := replace(sqlstmt, '${array_size}', to_char(array_size));
  sqlstmt := replace(sqlstmt, '${thr}', thr);
  sqlstmt := replace(sqlstmt, '${thrs}', thrs);
  execute immediate sqlstmt;
end;
```
The ORA_HASH function divides the ext_scan_events_dets table into 32 evenly distributed buckets, and then the SELECT statement retrieves the file names for bucket 0. For each file name in the bucket, the program sets the location of the external table to this file name. The program then uses batch processing to query the external table, insert into the staging table, and then commit.
While job 1 is executing, the other 31 Oracle Scheduler jobs execute in parallel. In this way, each job simultaneously reads a different subset of the scan event files, and inserts the records from its subset into the same staging table.
The manual parallelism technique has the following advantages over the alternative iterative techniques:
- It performs far better on large data sets because server processes are working in parallel.
- When the application uses ORA_HASH to distribute the workload, each thread of execution can access the same amount of data, which means that the parallel processes can finish at the same time.
The manual parallelism technique has the following disadvantages:
- The code is relatively lengthy, complicated, and difficult to understand.
- The application must perform a certain amount of preparatory work before the database can begin the main work, which is processing the rows in parallel.
- If multiple threads perform the same operations on a common set of database objects, then lock and latch contention is possible.
- Parallel processing consumes significant CPU resources compared to the competing iterative techniques.

### About Set-Based Processing
Set-based processing is a SQL technique that processes a data set inside the database.
In a set-based model, the SQL statement defines the result, and allows the database to determine the most efficient way to obtain it. In contrast, iterative algorithms use conditional logic to pull each each row or group of rows from the database to the client application, process the data on the client, and then send the data back to the database. Set-based processing eliminates the network round-trip and database API overhead because the data never leaves the database.
Assume the same functional requirement as in the previous examples. The following SQL statements meet this requirement using a set-based algorithm:
```
alter session enable parallel dml;
insert /*+ APPEND */ into stage1_scan_events d
  select s.* from ext_scan_events s;
commit;
```
Because the INSERT statement contains a subquery of the ext_scan_events table, a *single* SQL statement reads and writes all rows. Also, the application executes a *single* COMMIT after the database has inserted all rows. In contrast, iterative applications execute a COMMIT after the insert of each row or each group of rows.
The set-based technique has significant advantages over iterative techniques:
- As demonstrated in Real-World Performance demonstrations and classes, the performance on large data sets is orders of magnitude faster. It is not unusual for the run time of a program to drop from several hours to several seconds.
- A side-effect of the orders of magnitude increase in processing speed is that DBAs can eliminate long-running and error-prone batch jobs, and innvoate business processes in real time.
- The length of the code is significantly shorter, a short as two or three lines of code, because SQL defines the result and not the access method.
- In contrast to manual parallelism, parallel DML is optimized for performance because the database, rather than the application, manages the processes.
- When joining data sets, the database automatically uses highly efficient hash joins instead of relatively inefficient application-level loops.
- The APPEND hint forces a direct-path load, which means that the database creates no redo and undo, thereby avoiding the waste of I/O and CPU.
Set-based processing does have some potential disadvantages:
- The techniques are unfamiliar to many database developers, so they may be more difficult.
- Because a set-based model is completely different from an iterative model, changing it requires completely rewriting the source code.
