# Connecting to Oracle Database as User HR

To complete the tutorials and examples in this topic, you must connect to Oracle Database as the user `HR`.
The user `HR` owns the `HR` sample schema that the examples and tutorials in this topic use.
## Unlocking the HR Account
You must unlock the HR account and reset its password before you can connect to Oracle Database as the user HR.
By default, when the HR schema is installed, the HR account is locked and its password is expired.
**Note:**   For the following procedure, you need the name and password of a user who has the ALTER USERsystem privilege.
**Steps to unlock the HR account and reset its password:**
- Using SQL*Plus, connect to Oracle Database as a user with the ALTER USER system privilege.
******
- At the SQL> prompt, unlock the HR account and reset its password: Caution: Choose a secure password. For guidelines for secure passwords, see Oracle Database Security Guide.
```
```
ALTER USER HR ACCOUNT UNLOCK IDENTIFIED BY password;
```
The system responds:
```
User altered.
```
The `HR` account is unlocked and its password is password.
```
You can now connect to Oracle Database as user HR with the password password.
