# Auditing SQL Statements and Privileges in a Multitier Environment

You can create a unified audit policy to audit the activities of a client in a multitier environment.
In a multitier environment, Oracle Database preserves the identity of a client through all tiers. Thus, you can audit actions taken on behalf of the client by a middle-tier application, by using the `BY` *user* clause in the `AUDIT` statement for your policy. The audit applies to all user sessions, including proxy sessions.
The middle tier can also set the user client identity in a database session, enabling the auditing of end-user actions through the middle-tier application. The end-user client identity then shows up in the audit trail.
For example, suppose the proxy user `apphr` can connect as user `jackson`. The policy and enablement can be as follows:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY prox_pol ACTIONS LOGON;
AUDIT POLICY prox_pol BY jackson;
```
You can audit user activity in a multitier environment. Once audited, you can verify these activities by querying the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` data dictionary view. For example:
```
SELECT DBUSERNAME, DB_PROXY_USERNAME, PROXY_SESSIONID, ACTION_NAME
FROM UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL
WHERE DBPROXY_USERNAME IS NOT NULL;
```
Output similar to the following appears:
```
DBUSERNAME  DBPROXY_USERNAME  PROXY_SESSIONID  ACTION_NAME
----------  ----------------  ---------------  -----------
JACKSON     APPHR             1214623540       LOGON
```
The following figure illustrates how you can audit proxy users by querying the `PROXY_SESSIONID`, `ACTION_NAME`, and `SESSION_ID` columns of the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` view. In this scenario, both the database user and proxy user accounts are known to the database. Session pooling can be used.

The following figure illustrates how you can audit client identifier information across multiple database sessions by querying the `CLIENT_ID` column of the `DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL` data dictionary view. In this scenario, the client identifier has been set to `CLIENT_A`. As with the proxy user-database user scenario, session pooling can be used.
