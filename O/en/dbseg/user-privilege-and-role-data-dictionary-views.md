The following table lists views that you can query to access information about grants of privileges and roles.
This section provides some examples of using these views. For these examples, assume the following statements were issued:
```
CREATE ROLE security_admin IDENTIFIED BY password;
GRANT CREATE PROFILE, ALTER PROFILE, DROP PROFILE,
    CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY ROLE, GRANT ANY ROLE, AUDIT ANY,
    AUDIT SYSTEM, CREATE USER, BECOME USER, ALTER USER, DROP USER
    TO security_admin WITH ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT READ, DELETE ON SYS.AUD$ TO security_admin;
GRANT security_admin, CREATE SESSION TO swilliams;
GRANT security_admin TO system_administrator;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO jward;
GRANT READ, DELETE ON emp TO jward;
GRANT INSERT (ename, job) ON emp TO swilliams, jward;
```
## Query to List All System Privilege Grants
The `DBA_SYS_PRIVS` data dictionary view returns all system privilege grants made to roles and users.
For example:
```
SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE, ADM FROM DBA_SYS_PRIVS;
GRANTEE            PRIVILEGE                         ADM
--------------     --------------------------------- ---
SECURITY_ADMIN     ALTER PROFILE                     YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     ALTER USER                        YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     AUDIT ANY                         YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     AUDIT SYSTEM                      YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     BECOME USER                       YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     CREATE PROFILE                    YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     CREATE ROLE                       YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     CREATE USER                       YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     DROP ANY ROLE                     YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     DROP PROFILE                      YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     DROP USER                         YES
SECURITY_ADMIN     GRANT ANY ROLE                    YES
SWILLIAMS          CREATE SESSION                    NO
JWARD              CREATE SESSION                    NO
```
## Query to List All Role Grants
The `DBA_ROLE_PRIVS` query returns all the roles granted to users and other roles.
For example:
```
SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLE_PRIVS;
GRANTEE            GRANTED_ROLE                         ADM
------------------ ------------------------------------ ---
SWILLIAMS          SECURITY_ADMIN                       NO
```
## Query to List Object Privileges Granted to a User
The `DBA_TAB_PRIVS` and `DBA_COL_PRIVS` data dictionary views list object privileges that have bee granted to users.
The `DBA_TAB_PRIVS` data dictionary view returns all object privileges (not including column-specific privileges) granted to the specified user.
For example:
```
SELECT TABLE_NAME, PRIVILEGE, GRANTABLE FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS
    WHERE GRANTEE = 'jward';
TABLE_NAME   PRIVILEGE    GRANTABLE
-----------  ------------ ----------
EMP          SELECT       NO
EMP          DELETE       NO
```
To list all the column-specific privileges that have been granted, you can use the following query:
```
SELECT GRANTEE, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, PRIVILEGE
    FROM DBA_COL_PRIVS;
GRANTEE      TABLE_NAME     COLUMN_NAME      PRIVILEGE
-----------  ------------   -------------    --------------
SWILLIAMS    EMP            ENAME            INSERT
SWILLIAMS    EMP            JOB              INSERT
JWARD        EMP            NAME             INSERT
JWARD        EMP            JOB              INSERT
```
## Query to List the Current Privilege Domain of Your Session
The `SESSION_ROLES` and `SESSION_PRIVS` data dictionary views list the current privilege domain of a database session.
The `SESSION_ROLES` view lists all roles currently enabled for the issuer.
For example:
```
SELECT * FROM SESSION_ROLES;
```
If user `swilliams` has the `security_admin` role enabled and issues the previous query, then Oracle Database returns the following information:
```
ROLE
------------------------------
SECURITY_ADMIN
```
The following query lists all system privileges currently available in the security domain of the issuer, both from explicit privilege grants and from enabled roles:
```
SELECT * FROM SESSION_PRIVS;
```
If user `swilliams` has the `security_admin` role enabled and issues the previous query, then Oracle Database returns the following results:
```
PRIVILEGE
----------------------------------------
AUDIT SYSTEM
CREATE SESSION
CREATE USER
BECOME USER
ALTER USER
DROP USER
CREATE ROLE
DROP ANY ROLE
GRANT ANY ROLE
AUDIT ANY
CREATE PROFILE
ALTER PROFILE
DROP PROFILE
```
If the `security_admin` role is disabled for user `swilliams`, then the first query would return no rows, while the second query would only return a row for the `CREATE SESSION` privilege grant.
## Query to List Roles of the Database
The `DBA_ROLES` data dictionary view lists all roles of a database and the authentication used for each role.
For example:
```
SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLES;
ROLE                  PASSWORD
----------------      --------
CONNECT               NO
RESOURCE              NO
DBA                   NO
SECURITY_ADMIN        YES
```
## Query to List Information About the Privilege Domains of Roles
The `ROLE_ROLE_PRIVS`, `ROLE_SYS_PRIVS`, and `ROLE_TAB_PRIVS` data dictionary views list information about the privilege domains of roles.
For example:
```
SELECT GRANTED_ROLE, ADMIN_OPTION
   FROM ROLE_ROLE_PRIVS
   WHERE ROLE = 'SYSTEM_ADMIN';
GRANTED_ROLE              ADM
----------------          ----
SECURITY_ADMIN            NO
```
The following query lists all the system privileges granted to the `security_admin` role:
```
SELECT * FROM ROLE_SYS_PRIVS WHERE ROLE = 'SECURITY_ADMIN';
ROLE                    PRIVILEGE                      ADM
----------------------- -----------------------------  ---
SECURITY_ADMIN           ALTER PROFILE                 YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           ALTER USER                    YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           AUDIT ANY                     YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           AUDIT SYSTEM                  YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           BECOME USER                   YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           CREATE PROFILE                YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           CREATE ROLE                   YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           CREATE USER                   YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           DROP ANY ROLE                 YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           DROP PROFILE                  YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           DROP USER                     YES
SECURITY_ADMIN           GRANT ANY ROLE                YES
```
The following query lists all the object privileges granted to the `security_admin` role:
```
SELECT TABLE_NAME, PRIVILEGE FROM ROLE_TAB_PRIVS
    WHERE ROLE = 'SECURITY_ADMIN';
TABLE_NAME                     PRIVILEGE
---------------------------    ----------------
AUD$                           DELETE
AUD$                           SELECT
```
