# Customizing the Use of Strong Authentication

You can configure multiple authentication methods under Oracle Database native network encryption and strong authentication.
- Connecting to a Database Using Strong Authentication You can use password authentication to connect to a database that is configured to use strong authentication.
- Disabling Strong Authentication and Native Network Encryption You can use Oracle Net Manager to disable strong authentication and native network encryption.
- Configuring Multiple Authentication Methods Many networks use more than one authentication method on a single security server.
- Configuring Oracle Database for External Authentication You can use parameters to configure Oracle Database for network authentication.
## Connecting to a Database Using Strong Authentication
You can use password authentication to connect to a database that is configured to use strong authentication.
- To connect to an Oracle database server using a user name and password when an Oracle network and strong authentication method has been configured, disable the external authentication. You must first follow the instructions in Disabling Strong Authentication and Native Network Encryption to disable the external authentication before you can connect to an Oracle Database server using a user name and password when an Oracle network and strong authentication method has been configured.
- With the external authentication disabled, connect to the database using the following format:
```
% sqlplus username@net_service_name
Enter password: password
```
```
For example:
```
```
% sqlplus hr@emp
Enter password: password
```
**Note:**   You can configure multiple authentication methods, including both externally authenticated users and password authenticated users, on a single database.
## Disabling Strong Authentication and Native Network Encryption
You can use Oracle Net Manager to disable strong authentication and native network encryption.
**  - (UNIX) From $ORACLE_HOME/bin, enter the following command at the command line:
```
netmgr
```
```
- (Windows) Select **Start**, **Programs**, **Oracle - HOME_NAME**, **Configuration and Migration Tools**, then **Net Manager**.
```
************
- Expand Oracle Net Configuration, and from Local, select Profile.
********
- From the Naming list, select Network Security. The Network Security tabbed window appears.
****
- Select the Authentication tab (which is selected by default).
- Sequentially move all authentication methods from the Selected Method list to the Available Methods list by selecting a method and choosing the left arrow [<]. Description of the illustration auth0001.gif
****
- Select the Encryption tab.
********
  - From the Encryption menu, select SERVER.
********
  - Set Encryption Type to rejected.
****
  - In the Encryption Seed field, enter a valid encryption seed if an encryption seed was used.
********
  - Under Select Methods, move any methods to the Available Methods field.
********
- Repeat these steps disable native network encryption for the client, by selecting CLIENT from the Encryption menu.
********
- From the File menu, select Save Network Configuration. The sqlnet.ora file is updated with the following entries to indicate that strong authentication and native network encryption are disabled: Strong authentication:
```
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES = (NONE)
```
```
If you are using local database password authentication, then you can also set `SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=(NONE)` in the client. This setting improves client performance.
For native network encryption, you can set it individually, for the server side and for the client side. The following examples show native network encryption being disabled for both the server and the client:
```
```
SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER = REJECTED
SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT = REJECTED
```
```
Be aware that in a multitenant environment, the settings in the `sqlnet.ora` file apply to all pluggable databases (PDBs).
```
## Configuring Multiple Authentication Methods
Many networks use more than one authentication method on a single security server.
Accordingly, Oracle Database lets you configure your network so that Oracle clients can use a specific authentication method, and Oracle database servers can accept any method specified.
You can set up multiple authentication methods on both client and server systems either by using Oracle Net Manager, or by using any text editor to modify the `sqlnet.ora` file. Use Oracle Net Manager to add authentication methods to both clients and servers.
**  - (UNIX) From $ORACLE_HOME/bin, enter the following command at the command line:
```
netmgr
```
```
- (Windows) Select **Start**, **Programs**, **Oracle - HOME_NAME**, **Configuration and Migration Tools**, then **Net Manager**.
```
************
- Expand Oracle Net Configuration, and from Local, select Profile.
********
- From the Naming list, select Network Security. The Network Security tabbed window appears.
****
- Select the Authentication tab.
- Select a method listed in the Available Methods list.
- Sequentially move selected methods to the Selected Methods list by clicking the right arrow (>).
********
- Arrange the selected methods in order of desired use. To do this, select a method in the Selected Methods list, and select Promote or Demoteto position it in the list.
********
- From the File menu, select Save Network Configuration. The sqlnet.ora file is updated with the following entry, listing the selected authentication methods:
```
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES = (KERBEROS5, RADIUS)
```
**Note:**   SecurID functionality is available through RADIUS; RADIUS support is built into the RSA ACE/Server.
## Configuring Oracle Database for External Authentication
You can use parameters to configure Oracle Database for network authentication.
- Setting the SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES Parameter in sqlnet.ora The SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES parameter defines the authentication method and version to be used.
- Setting OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX to a Null Value The OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX parameter specifies a prefix that Oracle Database uses to authenticate users who attempt to connect to the server.
### Setting the SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES Parameter in sqlnet.ora
The `SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES` parameter defines the authentication method and version to be used.
You must set the `SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES` parameter in the `sqlnet.ora` file for all clients and servers to enable each to use a supported authentication method.
  - Set the SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES parameter using the following syntax:
```
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=(oracle_authentication_method)
```
For example, for all clients and servers using Kerberos authentication:
```
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=(KERBEROS5)
```
By default, the `sqlnet.ora` file is located in the *ORACLE_HOME*`/network/admin` directory or in the location set by the `TNS_ADMIN` environment variable. Ensure that you have properly set the `TNS_ADMIN` variable to point to the correct `sqlnet.ora` file.
If you are only using local database password authentication, then set the `SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES` as follows for better client performance:
```
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=(NONE)
```
### Setting OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX to a Null Value
The `OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX` parameter specifies a prefix that Oracle Database uses to authenticate users who attempt to connect to the server.
Authentication service-based user names can be long, and Oracle user names are limited to 128 bytes. Oracle strongly recommends that you set the `OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX` parameter to a null value.
  - In the initialization file for the database instance, set OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX as follows:
```
OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX=""
```
Note the following:
````
- The default value for OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX is OPS$; however, you can set it to any string.
````**
- If a database already has the OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX set to a value other than NULL (“ “), then do not change it, because it can inhibit previously created, externally identified users from connecting to the Oracle server.
After you have set `OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX` to null, then you can create external users by using the following syntax:
```
CREATE USER os_authent_prefix_username IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY;
```
For example, to create the user `king`:
```
CREATE USER king IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY;
```
The advantage of creating a user in this way is that you no longer need to maintain different user names for externally identified users. This is true for all supported authentication methods.
