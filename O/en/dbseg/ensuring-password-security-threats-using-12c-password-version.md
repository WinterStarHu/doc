## About the 12C Version of the Password Hash
The `12C` password hash protects against password-based security threats by including support for mixed case passwords.
The cryptographic hash function used for generating the `12C` version of the password hash is based on a de-optimized algorithm involving Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) and the SHA-512 cryptographic hash functions. The PBKDF2 algorithm introduces computational asymmetry in the challenge that faces an intruder who is trying to recover the original password when in possession of the `12C` version of the password hash. The `12C` password generation performs a SHA-512 hash of the PBKDF2 output as its last step. This two-step approach used in the `12C` password version generation allows server CPU resources to be conserved when the client has the O7L_MR capability. This is because during the password verification phase of the O5LOGON authentication, the server only needs to perform a single SHA-512 hash of a value transmitted by the O7L_MR capable client, rather than having to repeat the entire PBKDF2 calculation on the password itself.
In addition, the `12C` password version adds a salt to the password when it is hashed, which provides additional protection. The `12C` password version enables your users to create far more complex passwords. The `12C` password version’s use of salt, its use of PBKDF2 de-optimization, and its support for mixed-case passwords makes it more expensive for an intruder to perform dictionary or brute force attacks on the `12C` password version in an attempt to recover the user’s password. Oracle recommends that you use the `12C` version of the password hash.
The password hash values are considered to be extremely sensitive, because they are used as a “shared secret” between the server and person who is logging in. If an intruder learns this secret, then the protection of the authentication is immediately and severely compromised. Remember that administrative users who have account management privileges, administrative users who have the `SYSDBA` administrative privilege, or even users who have the `EXP_FULL_DATABASE` role can immediately access the password hash values. Therefore, this type of administrative user must be trustworthy if the integrity of the database password-based authentication is to be preserved. If you cannot trust these administrators, then it is better to deploy a directory server (such as Oracle Database Enterprise User Security) so that the password hash values remain within the Enterprise User Security directory and are never accessible to anyone except the Enterprise User Security administrator.
## Oracle Database 12C Password Version Configuration Guidelines
By default, Oracle Database generates two versions of the password hash: `11G` and `12C`.
The version of the password hash that Oracle Database uses to authenticate a given client depends on the client’s ability, and the settings for the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameters. See the column “Ability Required of the Client” in the “SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER Settings” table in the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter description in *Oracle Database Net Services Reference* for detailed information about how the client authentication works with password versions.
The `10G` password version, which was generated in Oracle Database 10g, is not case sensitive. Both the `11G` and `12C` password versions are case sensitive.
In Oracle Database 12g release 2 (
12.2), the `sqlnet.ora` parameter `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` defaults to `12`, which is Exclusive Mode and prevents the use of the `10G` password version, and the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT` parameter defaults to `11`. For new accounts, when the client is Oracle Database 12c, then Oracle Database uses the `12C` password version exclusively with clients that are running the Oracle Database 12c release software. For accounts that were created before Oracle Database release 12c, logins will succeed as long as the client has the O5L_NP ability, because an `11G` password version normally exists for accounts created in earlier releases such as Oracle Database release 11g. For a very old account (for example, from Oracle Database release 10g), the user’s password may need to be reset, in order to create a SHA-1 password version for the account. To configure this server to generate only the `12C` password version whenever a new account is created or an existing account password is changed, then set the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter to `12a`. However, if you want your applications to be compatible with older clients, then ensure that `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` is set to `12`, which is the default.
How you set the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter depends on the balance of security and interoperability with older clients that your system requires. You can control the levels of security as follows:
****````````````
- Greatest level of compatibility: To configure the server to generate all three versions of the password hash (the 12C password version, the 11G password version, and the DES-based 10G password version), whenever a new account is created or an existing account password is changed, set the SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER parameter to the value 11 or lower. (Be aware that earlier releases used the value 8 as the default.)
****````**``````
- Recommended level of security: To configure the server to generate both the 12C password version and the 11G password version (but not the 10G password version), whenever a new account is created or an existing account password is changed, set the SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER parameter to the value 12.
******``````
- Highest level of security: To configure the server to generate only the 12C password version whenever a new account is created or an existing account password is changed, set the SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER parameter to the value 12a.
During authentication, the following scenarios are possible, based on the kinds of password versions that exist for the account, and on the version of the client software being used:
  ****``````- Accounts with only the 10G version of the password hash: If you want to force the server to generate the newer versions of the password hash for older accounts, an administrator must expire the password for any account that has only the 10G password version (and none of the more secure password versions, 11G or 12C). You must generate these password versions because the database depends on using these password versions to provide stronger security. You can find these users as follows.
```
SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS
WHERE PASSWORD_VERSIONS LIKE '%10G%
AND USERNAME <> 'ANONYMOUS';
```
And then expire each account as follows:
```
ALTER USER username PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```
After you have expired each account, notify these users to log in, in which case they will be prompted to change their password. The version of the client determines the password version that is used. The setting of the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter determines the password versions that are generated. If the client has the O7L_MR ability (Oracle Database release 12c), then the 12C password version is used to authenticate. If the client has the O5L_NP ability but not the O7L_MR ability (such as Oracle Database release 11g clients), then the `11G` password version is used to authenticate. You should upgrade all clients to Oracle Database release 12c so that the `12C` password version can be used exclusively to authenticate. (By default, Oracle Database release 11.2.0.3 and later clients have the `O5L_NP` ability, which enables the `11G` password version to be used exclusively. If you have an earlier Oracle Database client, then you must install the CPUOct2012 patch.)
When an account password is expired and the `ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter is set to `12` or `12a`, then the `10G` password version is removed and only one or both of the new password versions are created, depending on how the parameter is set, as follows:
````````
- If ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER is set to 12 (the default), then both the 11G and 12C versions of the password hash are generated.
``````
- If ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER is set to 12a, then only the 12C version of the password hash is generated.
For more details, see the “Generated Password Version” column in the table in the “Usage Notes” section for the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter in *Oracle Database Net Services Reference***.**
****
- Accounts with both 10G and 11G versions of the password hash: For users who are using a Release 10g or later client, the user logins will succeed because the 11G version of the password hash is used. However, to use the latest version, expire these passwords, as described in the previous bulleted item for accounts.
****
- Accounts with only the 11G version of the password hash: The authentication uses the 11G version of the password hash. To use the latest version, expire the passwords, as described in the first bulleted item.
The Oracle Database 12*c* default configuration for `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` is `12`, which means that it is compatible with Oracle Database 12c release 2 (12.2) authentication protocols and later products that use OCI-based drivers, including SQL*Plus, ODBC, Oracle .NET, Oracle Forms, and various third-party Oracle Database adapters. It is also compatible with JDBC type-4 (thin) versions that have had the CPUOct2012 bundle patch applied or starting with Oracle Database 11g, and Oracle Database Client interface (OCI)-based drivers starting in Oracle Database 10g release 10.2. Be aware that earlier releases of the OCI client drivers cannot authenticate to an Oracle database using password-based authentication.
## Configuring Oracle Database to Use the 12C Password Version Exclusively
You should set the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter to `12a` so that only the `12C` password hash version is used.
The `12C` password version is the most restrictive and secure of the password hash versions, and for this reason, Oracle recommends that you use only this password version. By default, `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` is set to `12`, which enables both the `11G` and `12C` password versions to be used. (Both the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` values `12` and `12a` are considered Exclusive Mode, which prevents the use of the earlier `10G` password version.) If you have upgraded from a previous release, or if `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` is set to `12` or another setting that was used in previous releases, then you should reconfigure this parameter, because intruders will attempt to downgrade the authentication to use weaker password versions. The table later in this topic shows the effect of the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` setting on password version generation.
Be aware that you can use the `12C` password version exclusively only if you use Oracle Database 12c release 12.1.0.2 or later clients. Before you change the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter to `12a`, check the versions of the database clients that are connected to the server.
- Log in to SQL*Plus as an administrative user who has the ALTER USER system privilege.
- Perform the following SQL query to find the password versions of your users.
```
SELECT USERNAME,PASSWORD_VERSIONS FROM DBA_USERS;
```
````
- Expire the account of each user who does not have the 12C password version. For example, assuming user blake is still using a 10G password version:
```
ALTER USER blake PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```
```
The next time that these users log in, they will be forced to change their passwords, which enables the server to generate the password versions required for Exclusive Mode.
```
**
- Remind users to log in within a reasonable period of time (such as 30 days). When they log in, they will be prompted to change their password, ensuring that the password versions required for authentication in Exclusive Mode are generated by the server. (For more information about how Exclusive Mode works, see the usage notes for the SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER parameter in Oracle Database Net Services Reference.)
- Manually change the passwords for accounts that are used in test scripts or batch jobs so that they exactly match the passwords used by these test scripts or batch jobs, including the password’s case.
````
  - Create a back up copy of the sqlnet.ora parameter file. By default, this file is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX operating systems and the %ORACLE_HOME%\network\admin directory on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Be aware that in a Multitenant environment, the settings in the sqlnet.ora file apply to all PDBs.
  - Set the SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER parameter, using the following table for guidance.
The following table shows the effect of the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` setting on password version generation.
| SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER Setting | 8 | 11 | 12 | 12a |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Server runs in Exclusive Mode? | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Generate the 10G password version? | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Generate the 11G password version? | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Generate the 12C password version? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
If you only use Oracle Database 12c release 12.1.0.2 or later clients, then set `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` to `12a`.
The higher the setting, the more restrictive the use of password versions, as follows:
````
  - A setting of 12a, the most restrictive and secure setting, only permits the 12C password version.
``````
  - A setting of 12 permits both the 11G and 12C password versions to be used for authentication.
````````
  - A setting of 8 permits the most password versions: 10G, 11G, and 12C.
For detailed information about the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` parameter, see *Oracle Database Net Services Reference*.
**Note:** If your system hosts a fixed database link to a target database that runs an earlier release, then you can set the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT` parameter, as described in How Server and Client Logon Versions Affect Database Links.
        - Save the sqlnet.ora file.
## How Server and Client Logon Versions Affect Database Links
The `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER` and `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT` parameters can accommodate connections between databases and clients of different releases.
The following diagram illustrates how connections between databases and clients of different releases work. The `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT` parameter affects the “client allowed logon version” aspect of a server that hosts the database link **H**. This setting enables **H** to connect through database links to older servers, such as those running Oracle 9*i* (**T**), yet still refuse connections from older unpatched clients (**U**). When this happens, the Oracle Net Services protocol negotiation fails, which raises an `ORA-28040: No matching authentication protocol error` message in this client, which is attempting to authenticate using the Oracle 9*I* software. The Oracle Net Services protocol negotiation for Oracle Database 10*g* release 10.2 client **E** succeeds because this release incorporates the critical patch update CPUOct2012. The Oracle Net Services protocol negotiation for Release 11.2.0.3 client **C** succeeds because it uses a secure password version.
Description of the illustration dbseg_vm_001.png
This scenario uses the following settings for the system that hosts the database link **H**:
```
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT=8
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER=12
```
Note that the remote Oracle Database **T** has the following setting:
```
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION=8
```
If the release of the remote Oracle Database **T** does not meet or exceed the value defined by the `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT` parameter set for the host **H**, then queries over the fixed database link would fail during authentication of the database link user, resulting in an `ORA-28040: No matching authentication protocol` error when an end-user attempts to access a table over the database link.
```
  <div class="infoboxnote" markdown="1">
  **Note:**
  If you are using an older Oracle Database client (such as Oracle Database 11*g* release 11.1.0.7), then Oracle strongly recommends that you upgrade to use the critical patch update CPUOct2012.
  </div>
```
## Configuring Oracle Database Clients to Use the 12C Password Version Exclusively
An intruder may try to provision a fake server to downgrade authentication and trick the client into using a weaker password hash version.
``````
````  - To use the client Exclusive Mode setting to permit both the 11G and 12C password versions:
```
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT = 12
```
  **- To use the more restrictive client Exclusive Mode setting to permit only the 12C password version (this setting permits the client to connect only to Oracle Database 12c release 1 (12.1.0.2) and later servers):
```
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT = 12a
```
If the server and the client are both installed on the same computer, then ensure that the `TNS_ADMIN` environment variable for each points to the correct directory for its respective Oracle Net Services configuration files. If the variable is the same for both, then the server could use the client’s `SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT` setting instead.
If you are using older Oracle Database clients (such as Oracle Database 11*g* release 11.1.0.7), then you should apply CPU Oct2012 or later to these clients. This patch provides the `O5L_NP` ability. Unless you apply this patch, users will be unable to log in.
