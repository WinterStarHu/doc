## About Activating Encryption and Integrity
In any network connection, both the client and server can support multiple encryption algorithms and integrity algorithms.
When a connection is made, the server selects which algorithm to use, if any, from those algorithms specified in the `sqlnet.ora` files.The server searches for a match between the algorithms available on both the client and the server, and picks the first algorithm in its own list that also appears in the client list. If one side of the connection does not specify an algorithm list, all the algorithms installed on that side are acceptable. The connection fails with error message `ORA-12650` if either side specifies an algorithm that is not installed.
Encryption and integrity parameters are defined by modifying a `sqlnet.ora` file on the clients and the servers on the network.
You can choose to configure any or all of the available encryption algorithms, and either or both of the available integrity algorithms. Only one encryption algorithm and one integrity algorithm are used for each connect session.
**Note:**   Oracle Database selects the first encryption algorithm and the first integrity algorithm enabled on the client and the server. Oracle recommends that you select algorithms and key lengths in the order in which you prefer negotiation, choosing the strongest key length first.
## About Negotiating Encryption and Integrity
The `sqlnet.ora` file on systems using data encryption and integrity must contain some or all the `REJECTED`, `ACCEPTED`, `REQUESTED`, and `REQUIRED` parameters.
- About the Values for Negotiating Encryption and Integrity Oracle Net Manager can be used to specify four possible values for the encryption and integrity configuration parameters.
- REJECTED Configuration Parameter The REJECTED value disables the security service, even if the other side requires this service.
- ACCEPTED Configuration Parameter The ACCEPTED value enables the security service if the other side requires or requests the service.
- REQUESTED Configuration Parameter The REQUESTED value enables the security service if the other side permits this service.
- REQUIRED Configuration Parameter The REQUIRED value enables the security service or preclude the connection.
### About the Values for Negotiating Encryption and Integrity
Oracle Net Manager can be used to specify four possible values for the encryption and integrity configuration parameters.
The following four values are listed in the order of increasing security, and they must be used in the profile file (`sqlnet.ora`) for the client and server of the systems that are using encryption and integrity.
The value `REJECTED` provides the *minimum* amount of security between client and server communications, and the value `REQUIRED` provides the *maximum* amount of network security:
- REJECTED
- ACCEPTED
- REQUESTED
- REQUIRED
The default value for each of the parameters is `ACCEPTED.`
Oracle Database servers and clients are set to `ACCEPT` encrypted connections out of the box. This means that you can enable the desired encryption and integrity settings for a connection pair by configuring just one side of the connection, server-side or client-side.
So, for example, if there are many Oracle clients connecting to an Oracle database, you can configure the required encryption and integrity settings for all these connections by making the appropriate sqlnet.ora changes at the server end. You do not need to implement configuration changes for each client separately.
The following table shows whether the security service is enabled, based on a combination of client and server configuration parameters. If either the server or client has specified `REQUIRED`, the lack of a common algorithm *causes the connection to fail.*Otherwise, if the service is enabled, lack of a common service algorithm results in the service being *disabled*.
| Client Setting | Server Setting | Encryption and Data Negotiation |
|---|---|---|
| REJECTED | REJECTED | OFF |
| ACCEPTED | REJECTED | OFF |
| REQUESTED | REJECTED | OFF |
| REQUIRED | REJECTED | Connection fails |
| REJECTED | ACCEPTED | OFF |
| ACCEPTED | ACCEPTED | OFF1 |
| REQUESTED | ACCEPTED | ON |
| REQUIRED | ACCEPTED | ON |
| REJECTED | REQUESTED | OFF |
| ACCEPTED | REQUESTED | ON |
| REQUESTED | REQUESTED | ON |
| REQUIRED | REQUESTED | ON |
| REJECTED | REQUIRED | Connection fails |
| ACCEPTED | REQUIRED | ON |
| REQUESTED | REQUIRED | ON |
| REQUIRED | REQUIRED | ON |
### REJECTED Configuration Parameter
The `REJECTED` value disables the security service, even if the other side requires this service.
In this scenario, this side of the connection specifies that the security service is not permitted. If the other side is set to `REQUIRED`, the connection *terminates* with error message `ORA-12650`. If the other side is set to `REQUESTED`, `ACCEPTED`, or `REJECTED`, the connection continues without error and without the security service enabled.
### ACCEPTED Configuration Parameter
The `ACCEPTED` value enables the security service if the other side requires or requests the service.
In this scenario, this side of the connection does not require the security service, but it is enabled if the other side is set to `REQUIRED` or `REQUESTED`. If the other side is set to `REQUIRED` or `REQUESTED`, and an encryption or integrity algorithm match is found, the connection continues without error and with the security service enabled. If the other side is set to `REQUIRED` and no algorithm match is found, the connection terminates with error message `ORA-12650`.
If the other side is set to `REQUESTED` and no algorithm match is found, or if the other side is set to `ACCEPTED` or `REJECTED`, the connection continues without error and without the security service enabled.
### REQUESTED Configuration Parameter
The `REQUESTED` value enables the security service if the other side permits this service.
In this scenario, this side of the connection specifies that the security service is desired but not required. The security service is enabled if the other side specifies `ACCEPTED`, `REQUESTED`, or `REQUIRED`. There must be a matching algorithm available on the other side, otherwise the service is not enabled. If the other side specifies `REQUIRED` and there is no matching algorithm, *the connection fails.*
### REQUIRED Configuration Parameter
The `REQUIRED` value enables the security service or preclude the connection.
In this scenario, this side of the connection specifies that the security service *must be enabled*. The connection *fails* if the other side specifies `REJECTED` or if there is no compatible algorithm on the other side.

### Enabling Both Oracle Native Encryption and SSL Authentication for Different Users Concurrently
Depending on the `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER` settings, you can configure Oracle Database to allow both Oracle native encryption and SSL authentication for different users concurrently.
- About Enabling Both Oracle Native Encryption and SSL Authentication for Different Users Concurrently By default, Oracle Database does not allow both Oracle native encryption and Transport Layer Security (SSL) authentication for different users concurrently.
- Configuring Both Oracle Native Encryption and SSL Authentication for Different Users Concurrently Use the IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS parameter to enable the concurrent use of both Oracle native encryption and Transport Layer Security (SSL) authentication.
#### About Enabling Both Oracle Native Encryption and SSL Authentication for Different Users Concurrently
By default, Oracle Database does not allow both Oracle native encryption and Transport Layer Security (SSL) authentication for different users concurrently.
The use of both Oracle native encryption (also called Advanced Networking Option (ANO) encryption) and TLS authentication together is called double encryption.
There are cases in which both a TCP and TCPS listener must be configured, so that some users can connect to the server using a user name and password, and others can validate to the server by using a TLS certificate. In these situations, you must configure both password-based authentication and TLS authentication. A workaround in previous releases was to set the `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER` parameter to `requested`. If your requirements are that `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER` be set to `required`, then you can set the `IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS` parameter in both `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER` to `TRUE`. By default, it is set to `FALSE`.
Setting `IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS` to `TRUE` forces the client to ignore the value that is set for the `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT` parameter for all outgoing TCPS connections. This parameter allows the database to ignore the `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT` or `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER` setting when there is a conflict between the use of a TCPS client and when these two parameters are set to `required`.
#### Configuring Both Oracle Native Encryption and SSL Authentication for Different Users Concurrently
Use the `IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS` parameter to enable the concurrent use of both Oracle native encryption and Transport Layer Security (SSL) authentication.
On the server, you must set `IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS` in the `sqlnet.ora` file, and on the client, you can set it in either the `sqlnet.ora` file or the `tnsnames.ora` file.
- Log in to the database server
````````
- Go to the location of the sqlnet.ora file. By default, sqlnet.ora is in the ORACLE_BASE/network/admin directory. The sqlnet.ora file can also be stored in the directory specified by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable.
````````
- In sqlnet.ora, check if the current SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER setting is required or requested.
````````
```
IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS=TRUE
```
- If SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER is set to required, then add the SQLNET.IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS to sqlnet.ora and then set it to TRUE.
- Save and exit sqlnet.ora.
````
``````````
```
IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS=TRUE
```
  - Setting the value in sqlnet.ora: Check if the SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT parameter is set to required. If SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT, then edit the sqlnet.ora file to have the following setting:
``````````````````
```
test_tls=
    (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcps)(HOST=)(PORT=1750))
       (CONNECT_DATA=(SID=^ORACLE_SID^))
       (SECURITY=(IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS=TRUE))
     )
```
  - Setting the value in tnsnames.ora: By default, tnsnames.ora is in the same location as sqlnet.ora. If SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT is set to required in sqlnet.ora, then in the SECURITY portion of the TNS_ALIAS setting, set IGNORE_ANO_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TCPS=TRUE. For example:
