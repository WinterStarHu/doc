## Administrative User Accounts That Can Be Audited
Oracle Database provides administrative user accounts that are associated with administrative privileges.
The following table lists default administrative user accounts and the administrative privileges with which they are typically associated.
| Administrative User Account | Administrative Privilege |
|---|---|
| SYS | SYSDBA |
| PUBLIC1 | SYSOPER |
| SYSASM | SYSASM |
| SYSBACKUP | SYSBACKUP |
| SYSDG | SYSDG |
| SYSKM | SYSKM |
## Configuring a Unified Audit Policy to Capture Administrator Activities
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can audit administrative users.
  - To audit administrative users, create a unified audit policy and then apply this policy to the user, the same as you would for non-administrative users. Note that top-level statements by administrative users are mandatorily audited until the database opens.
## Example: Auditing the SYS User
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can audit the `SYS` user.
Example 27-5 shows how to audit grants of the `DBMS_FGA` PL/SQL package by user `SYS`.
Example 27-5 Auditing the SYS User
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY dbms_fga_grants
 ACTIONS GRANT
 ON DBMS_FGA;
AUDIT POLICY dbms_fga_grants BY SYS;
```
