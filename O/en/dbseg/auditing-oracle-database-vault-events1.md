## About Auditing Oracle Database Vault Events
As with all unified auditing, you must have the `AUDIT_ADMIN` role before you can audit Oracle Database Vault events.
To create Oracle Database Vault unified audit policies, you must set the `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement’s `COMPONENT` clause to `DV`, and then specify an action, such as `Rule Set Failure`, and an object, such as the name of a rule set.
To access the audit trail, you can query the following views:
- UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL
- AUDSYS.DV$CONFIGURATION_AUDIT
- AUDSYS.DV$ENFORCEMENT_AUDIT
In the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` view, the Oracle Database Vault-specific columns begin with `DV_`. You must have the `AUDIT_VIEWER` role before you can query the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` view.
In addition to these views, the Database Vault reports capture the results of Database Vault-specific unified audit policies.
## Who Is Audited in Oracle Database Vault?
Audited Oracle Database Vault users include administrators and users whose activities affect Database Vault enforcement policies.
These users are as follows:
****
- Database Vault administrators. All configuration changes that are made to Oracle Database Vault are mandatorily audited. The auditing captures activities such as creating, modifying, or deleting realms, factors, command rules, rule sets, rules, and so on. The AUDSYS.DV$CONFIGURATION_AUDIT data dictionary view captures configuration changes made by Database Vault administrators.
****
- Users whose activities affect Oracle Database Vault enforcement policies. The AUDSYS.DV$ENFORCEMENT_AUDIT data dictionary view captures enforcement-related audits
## About Oracle Database Vault Unified Audit Trail Events
The audit trail in an Oracle Database Vault environment captures all configuration changes or attempts at changes to Database Vault policies.
It also captures violations by users to existing Database Vault policies.
You can audit the following kinds of Oracle Database Vault events:
****
- All configuration changes or attempts at changes to Oracle Database Vault policies. It captures both Database Vault administrator changes and attempts made by unauthorized users.
****
- Violations by users to existing Database Vault policies. For example, if you create a policy to prevent users from accessing a specific schema table during non-work hours, the audit trail will capture this activity.

## Configuring a Unified Audit Policy for Oracle Database Vault
The `ACTIONS` and `ACTIONS COMPONENT` clauses in the `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can create unified audit policies for Oracle Database Vault events.
  - Use the following syntax to create an Oracle Database Vault unified audit policy:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY policy_name
 ACTIONS COMPONENT= DV DV_action ON DV_object [,DV_action2 ON DV_object2]
```
In this specification:
**
  - Realm-related actions: Realm Violation audits realm violations (for example, when an unauthorized user attempts to access a realm-protected object). Realm Success audits when a realm-protected object is successfully accessed by an authorized user. Realm Access audits both realm violation and realm success cases, that is, audits whenever the realm access attempt has been made, whether the access succeeded or failed.
``````
  - Rule set-related actions: Rule Set Failure, Rule Set Success, Rule Set Eval
``````````````
  - Factor-related actions: Factor Error, Factor Null, Factor Validate Error, Factor Validate False, Factor Trust Level Null, Factor Trust Level Neg, Factor All
**
**
  - Realm_Name
**
  - Rule_Set_Name
**
  - Factor_Name
If the object was created in lower or mixed case, then you must enclose *DV_objects* in double quotation marks. If you had created the object in all capital letters, then you can omit the quotation marks.
For example, to audit realm violations on the Database Vault Account Management realm:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY audit_dv
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=DV Realm Violation ON "Database Vault Account Management";
```
Remember that after you create the policy, you must use the `AUDIT` statement to enable it.
## Example: Auditing an Oracle Database Vault Realm
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can audit Oracle Database Vault realms.
Example 27-22 shows how to audit a realm violation on the `HR` schema.
Example 27-22 Auditing a Realm Violation
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY dv_realm_hr
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=DV Realm Violation ON "HR Schema Realm";
AUDIT POLICY dv_realm_hr;
```
## Example: Auditing an Oracle Database Vault Rule Set
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can audit Oracle Database Vault rule sets.
Example: Auditing an Oracle Database Vault Rule Set shows how to audit the Can Maintain Accounts/Profile rule set.
Example 27-23 Auditing a Rule Set
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY dv_rule_set_accts
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=DV RULE SET FAILURE ON "Can Maintain Accounts/Profile";
AUDIT POLICY dv_rule_set_accts;
```
## Example: Auditing Two Oracle Database Vault Events
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can audit multiple Oracle Database Vault events.
Example 27-24 shows how to audit a realm violation and a rule set failure.
Example 27-24 Auditing Two Oracle Database Vault Events
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY audit_dv
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=DV REALM VIOLATION ON "Oracle Enterprise Manager", Rule Set
 Failure ON "Allow Sessions";
AUDIT POLICY audit_dv;
```
## Example: Auditing Oracle Database Vault Factors
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can audit Oracle Database Vault factors.
Example 27-25 shows how to audit two types of errors for one factor.
Example 27-25 Auditing Oracle Database Vault Factor Settings
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY audit_dv_factor
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=DV FACTOR ERROR ON "Database_Domain", Factor Validate Error ON "Client_IP";
AUDIT POLICY audit_dv_factor;
```
## How Oracle Database Vault Audited Events Appear in the Audit Trail
The `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` data dictionary view lists Oracle Database Vault audited events.
The `DV_`* columns of the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` view show Oracle Database Vault-specific audit data.
For example:
```
SELECT DBUSERNAME, SQL_TEXT, UNIFIED_AUDIT_POLICIES, DV_ACTION_NAME, DV_ACTION_OBJECT_NAME, DV_RULE_SET_NAME
FROM UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL
WHERE AUDIT_TYPE = 'DATABASE VAULT'
ORDER BY EVENT_TIMESTAMP;
DBUSERNAME SQL_TEXT                   UNIFIED_AUDIT_POLICIES DV_ACTION_NAME        DV_ACTION_OBJECT_NAME DV_RULE_SET_NAME
---------- -------------------------- ----------------------- --------------------- --------------------- ------------------
PFITCH     SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES DV_AUDIT_POLICY         Command Failure Audit SELECT                HR_data_protection
```
