# Auditing Only Top-Level Statements

You can audit top-level SQL or PL/SQL statements to limit the volume of audit records.
- About Auditing Only Top-Level SQL Statements A top-level statement is a statement that is executed directly by a user, not a statement that is run from within a PL/SQL procedure.
````
- Configuring a Unified Audit Policy to Capture Only Top-Level Statements The ONLY TOPLEVEL clause in the CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement enables you to audit only the SQL statements that are directly issued by an end user by honoring the audit configuration in the audit policy.
- Example: Auditing Top-Level Statements The CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement can include or exclude top-level statement audit records in the unified audit trail for any user.
- Example: Comparison of Top-Level SQL Statement Audits You can generate top-level SQL statement audit records from SQL statements that are run directly in SQL or from within a PL/SQL procedure.
- How the Unified Audit Trail Captures Top-Level SQL Statements The ONLY TOPLEVEL clause has no impact on the output for an individual unified audit trail record.
## About Auditing Only Top-Level SQL Statements
A top-level statement is a statement that is executed directly by a user, not a statement that is run from within a PL/SQL procedure.
Consider auditing top-level statements from all users, including user `SYS` to reduce the volume of audit. The feature audits all the user-initiated actions and ignores the recursive SQL statements. For example, auditing the `DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DATABASE_STATS` SQL statement can generate over 200,000 individual audit records and by adding top-level this reduces to a single audit record.
## Configuring a Unified Audit Policy to Capture Only Top-Level Statements
The `ONLY TOPLEVEL` clause in the `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement enables you to audit only the SQL statements that are directly issued by an end user by honoring the audit configuration in the audit policy.
To find policies that include the `ONLY TOPLEVEL` clause, query the `AUDIT_ONLY_TOPLEVEL` column of the `AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES` data dictionary view.
Use the following syntax to create a unified audit policy that audits only top-level SQL statements.
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY policy_name
all_existing_options
ONLY TOPLEVEL;
```
For example, to limit the audit trail to top-level instances of the `SELECT` statement on the `HR.EMPLOYEES` table:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY actions_on_hr_emp_pol
ACTIONS SELECT ON HR.EMPLOYEES
ONLY TOPLEVEL;
```
## Example: Auditing Top-Level Statements
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can include or exclude top-level statement audit records in the unified audit trail for any user.
The following example shows an audit policy that will capture all top level statements executed by user `SYS`.
Example 27-35 Example: Auditing Top-Level Statements Executed by User SYS
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY actions_all_pol ACTIONS ALL
ONLY TOPLEVEL;
AUDIT POLICY actions_all_pol BY SYS;
```
## Example: Comparison of Top-Level SQL Statement Audits
You can generate top-level SQL statement audit records from SQL statements that are run directly in SQL or from within a PL/SQL procedure.
This example shows how generating audit records differs when you access a view outside a PL/SQL procedure as opposed to accessing the view inside the PL/SQL procedure. The output illustrates the difference in volume in audit records that are generated from the two different audit policies.

- Log in to the database instance as user SYS with the SYSDBA administrative privilege. In a multitenant environment, log in to the PDB. To find the available PDBs in a CDB, log in to the CDB root container and then query the PDB_NAME column of the DBA_PDBS data dictionary view. To check the current container, run the show con_name command.
```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE proc1 AS
cnt number;
BEGIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO CNT FROM SYS.DBA_USERS WHERE USER_ID=9999;
END;
/
```
- Create the following procedure:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY toplevel_pol ACTIONS ALL ONLY TOPLEVEL;
AUDIT POLICY toplevel_pol;
```
- Create the and enable following audit policy to capture top-level actions:
````
```
SELECT /* TOPLEVEL */ COUNT(*) FROM SYS.DBA_USERS WHERE USER_ID=0000;
```
```
  COUNT(*)
----------
         1
```
- Execute the following query to generate an audit record and to access the SYS.DBA_USERS view outside of the proc1 procedure that you just created: The output should be as follows:
````
```
EXEC proc1;
```
- Execute the proc1 procedure that you created earlier, to access the SYS.DBA_USERS view again, but from within a procedure.

## How the Unified Audit Trail Captures Top-Level SQL Statements
The `ONLY TOPLEVEL` clause has no impact on the output for an individual unified audit trail record.
The only effect that `ONLY TOPLEVEL` has on a policy is to limit the number of records generated for the given unified audit policy.
