# Modern Configuration

Learn how to configure RADIUS authentication using the modern configuration. It is recommended to use this configuration method.
- Step 1: Configure RADIUS Authentication To configure RADIUS authentication, you must first configure it on the Oracle client, then the server. Afterward, you can configure additional RADIUS features.
- Step 2: Create a User and Grant Access After you complete the RADIUS authentication, you must create an Oracle Database user who is responsible for the RADIUS configuration.
- Step 3: Configure External RADIUS Authorization (Optional) You must configure the Oracle server, the Oracle client, and the RADIUS server to RADIUS users who must connect to an Oracle database.
- Step 4: Configure RADIUS Accounting RADIUS accounting logs information about access to the Oracle database server and stores it in a file on the RADIUS accounting server.
- Step 5: Add the RADIUS Client Name to the RADIUS Server Database The RADIUS server that you select must comply with RADIUS standards.
- Step 6: Configure the Authentication Server for Use with RADIUS After you add the RADIUS client name to the RADIUS server database, you can configure the authentication server to use the RADIUS.
- Step 7: Configure the RADIUS Server for Use with the Authentication Server After you configure the authentication server for use with RADIUS, you can configure the RADIUS server to use the authentication server.
- Step 8: Configure Mapping Roles If the RADIUS server supports vendor type attributes, then you can manage roles by storing them in the RADIUS server.
## Step 1: Configure RADIUS Authentication
To configure RADIUS authentication, you must first configure it on the Oracle client, then the server. Afterward, you can configure additional RADIUS features.
Starting with Oracle Database
19.28, Oracle Database strengthens RADIUS authentication behavior to reduce exposure to BlastRADIUS-style downgrade and interception attacks. Please review both the client-to-database and database-to-RADIUS-server configuration. For more information, see *Step 1A: Configure RADIUS on the Oracle Client* and *Step 1B (2): Configure RADIUS Parameters on the Server (sqlnet.ora file)*
- Step 1A: Configure RADIUS on the Oracle Client You can use sqlnet.ora to configure RADIUS on the Oracle client.
- Step 1B: Configure RADIUS on the Oracle Database Server You must create a file to hold the RADIUS key and store this file on the Oracle database server. Then you must configure the appropriate parameters in the sqlnet.ora file.
- Step 1C: Configure Additional RADIUS Features You can change the default settings, configure the challenge-response mode, and set parameters for an alternate RADIUS server.
### Step 1A: Configure RADIUS on the Oracle Client
You can use `sqlnet.ora` to configure RADIUS on the Oracle client.
- Log in to the Oracle Database client that will use RADIUS.
```
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=(radius)
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALLOW_WEAK_PROTOCOL=TRUE
```
- Modify the parameters in the sqlnet.ora file as follows: This configuration enables you to use TCPS when you are connecting to the database server.
### Step 1B: Configure RADIUS on the Oracle Database Server
You must create a file to hold the RADIUS key and store this file on the Oracle database server. Then you must configure the appropriate parameters in the `sqlnet.ora` file.
- Step 1B (1): Create the RADIUS Secret Key File on the Oracle Database Server First, you must create the RADIUS secret key file.
- Step 1B (2): Configure RADIUS Parameters on the Server (sqlnet.ora file) After you create RADIUS secret key file, you are ready to configure the appropriate parameters in the sqlnet.ora file.
````
- Step 1B (3): Set Oracle Database Server Initialization Parameters After you configure the sqlnet.ora file, you must configure the init.ora initialization file.
#### Step 1B (1): Create the RADIUS Secret Key File on the Oracle Database Server
First, you must create the RADIUS secret key file.
- Obtain the RADIUS secret key from the RADIUS server. For each RADIUS client, the administrator of the RADIUS server creates a shared secret key, which must be less than or equal to 16 characters.
**
  - (UNIX) $ORACLE_HOME/network/security
****
  - (Windows) ORACLE_BASEORACLE_HOME\network\security
- Create the file radius.key to hold the shared secret copied from the RADIUS server. Place the file in the directory you created earlier in this procedure.
- Copy the shared secret key and paste it (and nothing else) into the radius.key file created on the Oracle database server.
- For security purposes, change the file permission of radius.key to read only, accessible only by the Oracle owner. Oracle relies on the file system to keep this file secret.
#### Step 1B (2): Configure RADIUS Parameters on the Server (sqlnet.ora file)
After you create RADIUS secret key file, you are ready to configure the appropriate parameters in the `sqlnet.ora` file.
**Note:**
````
- Starting with Oracle AI Database 26ai, users authenticating to the database using the legacy RADIUS API no longer are granted administrative privileges. In previous releases, users authenticating with RADIUS API could be granted administrative privileges such as SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP. In Oracle AI Database 26ai, Oracle introduces a new RADIUS API that uses the latest standards. To grant administrative privileges to users, ensure the database connection to the database uses the new RADIUS API, and that you are using the Oracle AI Database 26ai client to connect to the Oracle AI Database 26ai server.
````````
- Oracle AI Database 26ai introduces an updated RADIUS API based on RFC 6613 and RFC 6614 and has backported this to Oracle Database 19.28. Oracle recommends that you start planning on migrating to use the new RADIUS API as soon as possible. The new API is available by default. These parameters associated with the older RADIUS API are also deprecated: SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE, SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_PORT, SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION, and SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_PORT. Refer to the Radius API documentation for information on changing the default to use the newer RADIUS API.
- Log in to the Oracle Database server that will use RADIUS.
```
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=radius
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALLOW_WEAK_CLIENTS=TRUE
SQLNET.RADIUS_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=TLS
SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_TLS_HOST=RADIUS_host_name
SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_TLS_PORT=listening_TLS_port_of_primary_RADIUS_server
```
  - SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES sets the authentication service to be for RADIUS.
``````
````
    - For database clients to connect to a server using the older protocol: set the SQLNET.RADIUS_ALLOW_WEAK_CLIENTS parameter to TRUE.
````
    - For an Oracle AI Database 26ai or later server to connect to a RADIUS server using the older protocol: set the SQLNET.RADIUS_ALLOW_WEAK_PROTOCOL parameter to TRUE.
    - For the Oracle Database server to RADIUS server path, set SQLNET.RADIUS_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=TLS for the stronger transport mode.
**Note:**  If `SQLNET.RADIUS_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=TLS` is used, the required TLS or wallet or certificate configuration for that environment must also be present.
```
  - For backward-compatibility and to use UDP for the database-to-RADIUS-server path, set `SQLNET.RADIUS_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=UDP`
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_TLS_HOST` sets the host name of the RADIUS server. This value is mandatory.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_TLS_PORT` sets the listening port of a primary RADIUS server. The default port is `2083`. If the server uses a different port, then specify that value here.
If you need to use the earlier, deprecated RADIUS API parameters, then set the `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALLOW_WEAK_CLIENTS` and `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALLOW_WEAK_PROTOCOL` parameters to `TRUE`. The deprecated parameters are:
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE`
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION=RADIUS_SERVER_[host_name|IP_address]`
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_PORT`
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_PORT`
In this specification:
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE` specifies an alternate RADIUS server if the primary server is unavailable.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION` specifies the host name or IP address of the RADIUS server. The `IP_address` can either be an Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) address. The RADIUS adapter supports both IPv4 and IPv6 based servers.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_PORT` specifies the listening port of the alternate RADIUS server.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION` specifies a primary RADIUS server location, either by its host name or its IP address.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_PORT` specifies the listening port of a primary RADIUS server.
```
This procedure does not configure the Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection between the Oracle Database server and client; additional configuration is required.
#### Step 1B (3): Set Oracle Database Server Initialization Parameters
After you configure the `sqlnet.ora` file, you must configure the `init.ora` initialization file.
  - Add the following setting to the init.ora file.
```
OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX=""
```
```
By default, the `init.ora` file is located in the *ORACLE_HOME*`/dbs` directory (or the same location of the data files) on Linux and UNIX systems, and in the *ORACLE_HOME*`\database` directory on Windows.
```
- Restart the database. For example:
```
SQL> SHUTDOWN
SQL> STARTUP
```
### Step 1C: Configure Additional RADIUS Features
You can change the default settings, configure the challenge-response mode, and set parameters for an alternate RADIUS server.
- Step 1C(1): Change Default Settings You can edit the sqlnet.ora file to change the default RADIUS settings.
- Step 1C(2): Configure Challenge-Response Mode To configure challenge-response mode, you must specify information such as a dynamic password that you obtain from a token card.
- Step 1C(3): Set Parameters for an Alternate RADIUS Server If you are using an alternate RADIUS server, then you must set additional parameters.
#### Step 1C(1): Change Default Settings
You can edit the `sqlnet.ora` file to change the default RADIUS settings.
- Log in to the Oracle Database server that will use RADIUS.
- Modify the following sqlnet.ora parameters:
```
SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_PORT=(port)
SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_TIMEOUT=(number_of_seconds_to_wait_for_response)
SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_RETRIES=(number_of_times_to re-send_to_radius_server)
SQLNET.RADIUS_SECRET=(path/.radius.key)
```
```
In this specification:
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_PORT` specifies the listening port of a primary RADIUS server. The default is `1812`.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_TIMEOUT` specifies the amount of time in seconds that the database should wait for a response from a primary RADIUS server. The default is `5`.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_RETRIES` specifies the number of times that the database should resend messages to a primary RADIUS server. The default is `3`.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_SECRET` specifies the location of a file that contains the RADIUS secret key, which is a shared secret between a RADIUS client and server. The default is `radsec`, which points to `ORACLE_HOME/network/security/radius.key`. If you set a different RADIUS secret key file, then ensure that you set `SQLNET.RADIUS_SECRET` on the client as well as the database server. If the RADIUS server uses TLS as the protocol, then you can omit this parameter. For a RADIUS implementation that uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the default parameter value cannot be used. The default value of `radsec` can only be used if you are using RADIUS with TLS over TCP.
```
#### Step 1C(2): Configure Challenge-Response Mode
To configure challenge-response mode, you must specify information such as a dynamic password that you obtain from a token card.
With the RADIUS adapter, this interface is Java-based to provide optimal platform independence. Note that third-party vendors of authentication devices must customize this graphical user interface to fit their particular device. For example, a smart card vendor would customize the Java interface so that the Oracle client reads data, such as a dynamic password, from the smart card. When the smart card receives a challenge, it responds by prompting the user for more information, such as a PIN.
- Log in to the Oracle Database server that will use RADIUS.
  - On UNIX, enter this command at the prompt:
```
% setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/local/packages/jre1.1.7B
```
```
- On Windows, select **Start**, **Settings**, **Control Panel**, **System**, **Environment**, and set the `JAVA_HOME` variable as follows:
```
```
c:\java\jre1.1.7B
```
```
This step is not required for any other JDK/JRE version.
```
  - Modify the following sqlnet.ora parameters:
```
SQLNET.RADIUS_CHALLENGE_RESPONSE=([on | off])
SQLNET.RADIUS_DEFAULT_CHALLENGE_KEYWORD=(keyword)
SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_INTERFACE=(default_RADIUS_interface)
```
```
In this specification:
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_CHALLENGE_RESPONSE` enables or disables the challenge responses. To enable, enter `on`; to disable, enter `off`. The default is `off`.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_DEFAULT_CHALLENGE_KEYWORD` enables you to set challenge keyword. The default is `keyword`. The keyword feature is supported by some but not all RADIUS servers. You can use this feature only if the RADIUS server supports it.
  By setting a keyword, you let the user avoid using a password to verify identity. If the user does *not* enter a password, the keyword you set here is passed to the RADIUS server which responds with a challenge requesting, for example, a driver's license number or birth date. If the user *does* enter a password, the RADIUS server may or may not respond with a challenge, depending upon the configuration of the RADIUS server.
- `SQLNET.RADIUS_AUTHENTICATION_INTERFACE` specifies the class that contains the user interface for interacting with users. Enter the name of interface including the package name delimited by the character `/` for the `.` character.
  If other than the default RADIUS interface is used, then you also must edit the `sqlnet.ora` file to enter `SQLNET.RADIUS_CLASSPATH=(location)`, where `location` is the complete path name of the jar file. It defaults to *$*`ORACLE_HOME/network/jlib/netradius.jar: `*$*`ORACLE_HOME/JRE/lib/vt.jar`
```
#### Step 1C(3): Set Parameters for an Alternate RADIUS Server
If you are using an alternate RADIUS server, then you must set additional parameters.
  - Set the following parameters in the sqlnet.ora file:
```
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE=(hostname_or_IP_address_of_alternate_RADIUS_server)
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_PORT=(1812)
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_TIMEOUT=(number_of_seconds_to_wait_for_response)
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_RETRIES=(number_of_times_to re-send_to_RADIUS_server)
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_TLS_HOST=(TLS_host)
SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_TLS_PORT=(TLS_port)
```
**Note:**  Starting with Oracle AI Database 26ai, the `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE` and `SQLNET.RADIUS_ALTERNATE_PORT` parameters are deprecated.
## Step 2: Create a User and Grant Access
After you complete the RADIUS authentication, you must create an Oracle Database user who is responsible for the RADIUS configuration.
- Connect to the CDB root or to the PDB in which RADIUS is implemented. For example:
```
CONNECT system@pdb_name;
Enter password: password
```
  - Create the user as a common user if you connected to the CDB root, or as a local user if you connected to a PDB..
```
CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO USER user_name;
```
  **- Enter the user username in the RADIUS server’s users file.
## Step 3: Configure External RADIUS Authorization (Optional)
You must configure the Oracle server, the Oracle client, and the RADIUS server to RADIUS users who must connect to an Oracle database.
- Step 3A: Configure the Oracle Server (RADIUS Client) You can edit the init.ora file to configure an Oracle server for a RADIUS client.
- Step 3B: Configure the Oracle Client Where Users Log In Next, you must configure the Oracle client where users log in.
- Step 3C: Configure the RADIUS Server To configure the RADIUS server, you must modify the RADIUS server attribute configuration file.
### Step 3A: Configure the Oracle Server (RADIUS Client)
You can edit the `init.ora` file to configure an Oracle server for a RADIUS client.
To do so, you must modify the `init.ora` file, restart the database, and the set the RADIUS challenge-response mode.
- Set the RADIUS challenge-response mode to ON for the server if you have not already done so.
- Add externally identified users and roles.
### Step 3B: Configure the Oracle Client Where Users Log In
Next, you must configure the Oracle client where users log in.
  - Set the RADIUS challenge-response mode to ON for the client if you have not already done so.
### Step 3C: Configure the RADIUS Server
To configure the RADIUS server, you must modify the RADIUS server attribute configuration file.

| ATTRIBUTE NAME | CODE | TYPE |
|---|---|---|
| VENDOR_SPECIFIC | 26 | Integer |
| ORACLE_ROLE | 1 | String |

- Add the following attributes to the RADIUS server attribute configuration file:
```
VALUE     VENDOR_SPECIFIC     ORACLE     111
```
- Assign a Vendor ID for Oracle in the RADIUS server attribute configuration file that includes the SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code of 111. For example, enter the following in the RADIUS server attribute configuration file:
```
ORA_databaseSID_rolename
```
  - ORA designates that this role is used for Oracle purposes
````
****
  - databaseSID is the Oracle system identifier that is configured in the database init.ora file. By default, the init.ora file is located in the ORACLE_HOME/dbs directory (or the same location of the data files) on Linux and UNIX systems, and in the ORACLE_HOME\database directory on Windows.
````
  - rolename is the name of role as it is defined in the data dictionary after you remove the SYS prefix.
Ensure that RADIUS groups that map to Oracle roles adhere to the `ORACLE_ROLE` syntax.
For example:
```
USERNAME     USERPASSWD="user_password",
             SERVICE_TYPE=login_user,
             VENDOR_SPECIFIC=ORACLE,
             ORACLE_ROLE=ORA_oradb_dba
```
## Step 4: Configure RADIUS Accounting
RADIUS accounting logs information about access to the Oracle database server and stores it in a file on the RADIUS accounting server.
Use this feature only if both the RADIUS server and authentication server support it.
- Step 4A: Set RADIUS Accounting on the Oracle Database Server You can use sqlnet.ora to enable RADIUS accounting on the server.
- Step 4B: Configure the RADIUS Accounting Server RADIUS Accounting Server resides on the same host as the RADIUS authentication server or on a separate host.
### Step 4A: Set RADIUS Accounting on the Oracle Database Server
You can use `sqlnet.ora` to enable RADIUS accounting on the server.
- Log in to the Oracle Database server that will use RADIUS.
````
- Modify the SQLNET.RADIUS_SEND_ACCOUNTING parameter in the sqlnet.ora file as follows:
```
SQLNET.RADIUS_SEND_ACCOUNTING=on
```
```
When you enable accounting, packets are sent to the active RADIUS server at the listening port number's value plus one.
```
### Step 4B: Configure the RADIUS Accounting Server
RADIUS Accounting Server resides on the same host as the RADIUS authentication server or on a separate host.
  - See the administration documentation for the RADIUS server, for information about configuring RADIUS accounting.
## Step 5: Add the RADIUS Client Name to the RADIUS Server Database
The RADIUS server that you select must comply with RADIUS standards.
You can use any RADIUS server that complies with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC #2138, *Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)*, and RFC #2139 *RADIUS Accounting* standards. Because RADIUS servers vary, consult the documentation for your particular RADIUS server for any unique interoperability requirements.
- Open the clients file, which is located in /etc/raddb/clients. The following text and table appear:
```
@ (#) clients 1.1 2/21/96 Copyright 1991 Livingston Enterprises Inc
This file contains a list of clients which are allowed to make authentication requests and
their encryption key. The first field is a valid hostname. The second field (separated by
blanks or tabs) is the encryption key.
Client Name                     Key
```
````
- In the CLIENT NAME column, enter the host name or IP address of the host on which the Oracle database server is running. In the KEY column, type the shared secret. The value you enter in the CLIENT NAME column, whether it is the client’s name or IP address, depends on the RADIUS server.
- Save and close the clients file.
## Step 6: Configure the Authentication Server for Use with RADIUS
After you add the RADIUS client name to the RADIUS server database, you can configure the authentication server to use the RADIUS.
  - Refer to the authentication server documentation for instructions about configuring the authentication servers.
## Step 7: Configure the RADIUS Server for Use with the Authentication Server
After you configure the authentication server for use with RADIUS, you can configure the RADIUS server to use the authentication server.
  - Refer to the RADIUS server documentation for instructions about configuring the RADIUS server for use with the authentication server.
## Step 8: Configure Mapping Roles
If the RADIUS server supports vendor type attributes, then you can manage roles by storing them in the RADIUS server.
The Oracle database server downloads the roles when there is a `CONNECT` request using RADIUS.To use this feature, you must configure roles on both the Oracle database server and the RADIUS server.
****
- Use a text editor to set the OS_ROLES parameter in the initialization parameters file on the Oracle database server. By default, the init.ora file is located in the ORACLE_HOME/dbs directory (or the same location of the data files) on Linux and UNIX systems, and in the ORACLE_HOME\database directory on Windows.
- Stop and restart the Oracle database server. For example:
```
SHUTDOWN
STARTUP
```
- Create each role that the RADIUS server will manage on the Oracle database server with the value IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY. To configure roles on the RADIUS server, use the following syntax:
```
ORA_DatabaseName.DatabaseDomainName_RoleName
```
```
In this specification:
- `DatabaseName` is the name of the Oracle database server for which the role is being created. This is the same as the value of the DB_NAME initialization parameter.
- `DatabaseDomainName` is the name of the domain to which the Oracle database server belongs. The value is the same as the value of the `DB_DOMAIN` initialization parameter.
- `RoleName` is name of the role created in the Oracle database server.
For example:
```
```
ORA_USERDB.US.EXAMPLE.COM_MANAGER
```
  - Configure RADIUS challenge-response mode.
