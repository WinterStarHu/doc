- These data dictionary views will continue to show audit data from audit records that are still in the SYS.AUD$ and SYS.FGA_LOG$ system tables. Unified audit trail records are shown only in the unified audit trail-specific views. You must be granted the AUDIT_ADMIN or AUDIT_VIEWER role to query any views that are not prefaced with USER_. ↩
