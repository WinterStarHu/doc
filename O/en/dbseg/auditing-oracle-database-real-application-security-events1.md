## About Auditing Oracle Database Real Application Security Events
You must have the `AUDIT_ADMIN` role to audit Oracle Database Real Application Security events.
To access the audit trail, you can query the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` data dictionary view, whose Real Application Security-specific columns begin with `XS_`. If you want to find audit information about the internally generated VPD predicate that is created while an Oracle Real Application Security policy is being enabled, then you can query the `RLS_INFO` column.
Real Application Security-specific views are as follows:
- DBA_XS_AUDIT_TRAIL provides detailed information about Real Application Security events that were audited.
- DBA_XS_AUDIT_POLICY_OPTIONS describes the auditing options that were defined for Real Application Security unified audit policies.
- DBA_XS_ENB_AUDIT_POLICIES lists users for whom Real Application Security unified audit polices are enabled.
## Oracle Database Real Application Security Auditable Events
Oracle Database provides Real Application Security events that you can audit, such `CREATE USER`, `UPDATE USER`.
To find a list of auditable Real Application Security events that you can audit, you can query the `COMPONENT` and `NAME` columns of the `AUDITABLE_SYSTEM_ACTIONS` data dictionary view, as follows:
```
SELECT NAME FROM AUDITABLE_SYSTEM_ACTIONS WHERE COMPONENT = 'XS';
NAME
-------------
CREATE USER
UPDATE USER
DELETE USER
...
```
## Oracle Database Real Application Security User, Privilege, and Role Audit Events
The unified audit trail can capture Oracle Database Real Application Security events for users, privileges, and roles. The following table describes various audit events for Real Application Security.
**Note:**  An audit policy created on any standard action(s): `CREATE USER`, `ALTER USER`, `DROP
                USER`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `CREATE
                ROLE`, `ALTER ROLE`, `DROP ROLE`, and `CHANGE PASSWORD` will also audit the respective RAS action(s). Oracle has added the equivalent RAS component action(s), such as `GRANT
                PRIVILEGE` and `GRANT ROLE`, to the audit policy definition if the policy contained any of the previously stated standard actions, such as `GRANT`. The XS component actions added to the audit policy definition are visible in `AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES`.

## Configuring a Unified Audit Policy for Oracle Database Real Application Security
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can create a unified audit policy for Oracle Real Application Security.
  - Use the following syntax to create a unified audit policy for Oracle Database Real Application Security:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY policy_name
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=XS component_action1 [, action2];
```
For example:
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY audit_ras_pol
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=XS SWITCH USER, DISABLE ROLE;
```
You can build more complex policies, such as those that include conditions. Remember that after you create the policy, you must use the `AUDIT` statement to enable it.
## Example: Auditing Real Application Security User Account Modifications
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can audit Real Application Security user account modifications.
Example 27-20 shows how to audit user `bhurst'`s attempts to switch users and disable roles.
Example 27-20 Auditing Real Application Security User Account Modifications
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY ras_users_pol
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=XS SWITCH USER, DISABLE ROLE;
AUDIT POLICY ras_users_pol BY bhurst;
```
## Example: Using a Condition in a Real Application Security Unified Audit Policy
The `CREATE AUDIT POLICY` statement can set a condition for a Real Application Security unified audit policy.
Example 27-21 shows how to create Real Application Security unified audit policy that applies the audit only to actions from the `nemosity` computer host.
Example 27-21 Using a Condition in a Real Application Security Unified Audit Policy
```
CREATE AUDIT POLICY ras_acl_pol
 ACTIONS DELETE ON OE.CUSTOMERS
 ACTIONS COMPONENT=XS CREATE ACL, UPDATE ACL, DELETE ACL
 WHEN 'SYS_CONTEXT(''USERENV'', ''HOST'') = ''nemosity'''
 EVALUATE PER INSTANCE;
AUDIT POLICY ras_acl_pol BY pfitch;
```
## How Oracle Database Real Application Security Events Appear in the Audit Trail
The `DBA_XS_AUDIT_TRAIL` data dictionary view lists Oracle Real Application Security audit events.
The following example queries the Real Application Security-specific view, `DBA_XS_AUDIT_TRAIL`:
```
SELECT XS_USER_NAME FROM DBA_XS_AUDIT_TRAIL
WHERE XS_ENABLED_ROLE = 'CLERK';
XS_USER_NAME
-------------
USER2
```
