# Managing Gradual Database Password Rollover for Applications

A gradual database password rollover enables the database password of an application to be updated while avoiding application downtime while the new password is propagated to application clients, by allowing the older password to remain valid for a specified period.

## About Managing Gradual Database Password Rollover for Applications
You can configure a gradual database password rollover process to begin for database application clients when the database administrator changes the database password for the application.
When the database or application administrator changes the password for the application in the database, the applications must be updated with the new database password. Setting the `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` parameter in the user’s profile enables a password change to take place without having to risk downtime or application outages that could occur as a result of an application attempting to use an outdated password. The password rollover takes place seamlessly from the server and works with all existing supported client versions.
The gradual database password rollover feature is designed for database accounts (service accounts) for applications. The application could be a single server (database client) or scaled out to multiple servers with multiple database clients. It is not designed for administrative users; hence, administrative users are restricted from using this feature, no matter which profile they are associated with. You cannot grant administrative privileges to users who have a password rollover-enabled profile.
You can configure the gradual database password rollover for native password-authenticated user connections. If you convert a password database account to a `NO AUTHENTICATION` account, then Oracle Database deletes the password and verifiers that are associated with this account. When a password-authenticated user account is converted to a `GLOBAL`, an `EXTERNAL` or a `NO AUTHENTICATION` account, then the user implicitly exits the password rollover period. Gradual password rollover supports the `11g` password version and later.
You also can configure the gradual database password rollover for environments that use connected user database links. In this case, when you configure the gradual database password rollover, ensure that you also put the target account into rollover on the target of the connected user database link, and then roll over the target accounts on these links as well. To put the target account into rollover, you would use this syntax:
```
ALTER USER username IDENTIFIED BY same_new_rollover_password;
```
You cannot configure the gradual database password rollover for the following kinds of connections:
- Direct logins for Oracle Real Application Security users
- Kerberos-, certificate-, or RADIUS-based externally authenticated connections
- Centrally managed user (CMU) connections
- Administrative connections that use external password files
- The Oracle Data Guard connection between the primary and the standby
## Password Change Life Cycle During a Gradual Database Password Rollover
After a password is created or changed, it follows a life cycle and grace period in four phases.
The following diagram shows the life cycle of the password lifetime and grace period.
Description of the illustration password_rollover_cycle.png
In this figure:
****
****  - Phase 1a begins with the password change. During Phase 1a, the user can log in using either the old password or the new password. The duration of phase 1a is normally PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME, but if the administrator was able to update the password in all client applications sooner than this, they can decide to end the password rollover period sooner by issuing the following command, which makes the new password the only one that is accepted.
```
ALTER USER username EXPIRE PASSWORD ROLLOVER PERIOD;
```
****
- Phase 1b corresponds to the time remaining after the password rollover period expires until the end of PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME. During Phase 1b, the user can log in using only the new password.
********
- Phase 2: This phase represents the period of time after the password lifetime ends but before the user logs in again with the correct password. The correct credentials are needed for Oracle Database to update the account status. Otherwise, the account status will remain unchanged. Oracle Database does not have any background process to update the account status. All changes to the account status are driven by the Oracle Database server process on behalf of authenticated users.
****````````````````
- Phase 3: When the user finally does log in, the grace period begins. Oracle Database then updates the DBA_USERS.EXPIRY_DATE column to a new value using the current time plus the value of the PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME setting from the account’s password profile. At this point, the user receives an ORA-28002 warning message about the password expiring in the near future (for example, ORA-28002 The password will expire within 7 days if PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME is set to 7 days), but the user can still log in without changing the password. The DBA_USERS.EXPIRY_DATE column shows the time in the future when the user will be prompted to change their password.
****````
- Phase 4: After the grace period (Phase 3) ends, the ORA-28001: The password has expired error appears, and the user is prompted to change the password after entering the current, correct password before the authentication can proceed. If the user has an Oracle Active Data Guard configuration, where there is a primary and a stand-by database, and the authentication attempt is made on the standby database (which is a read-only database), then the ORA-28032: Your password has expired and the database is set to read-only error appears. The user should log into the primary database and change the password there.
During any of these four phases, you can query the `DBA_USERS` data dictionary view to find the user’s account status in the `DBA_USERS.ACCOUNT_STATUS` column.
In the following example, the profile assigned to `johndoe` includes the specification of a grace period: `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME = 3` (the recommended value). The first time `johndoe` tries to log in to the database after 90 days (this can be *any* day after the 90th day, that is, the 91st day, 100th day, or another day), he receives a warning message that his password will expire in 3 days. If 3 days pass, and if he does not change his password, then the password expires. After this, he receives a prompt to change his password on any attempt to log in.
```
CREATE PROFILE prof LIMIT
 FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 4
 PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 90
 PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME 3;
ALTER USER johndoe PROFILE prof;
```
A database administrator or a user who has the `ALTER USER` system privilege can explicitly expire a password by using the `CREATE USER` and `ALTER USER` statements. The following statement creates a user with an expired password. This setting forces the user to change the password before the user can log in to the database.
```
CREATE USER jbrown
 IDENTIFIED BY password
 ...
 PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```
There is no “password unexpire” clause for the `CREATE USER` statement, but an account can be “unexpired” by changing the password on the account.
## Enabling the Gradual Database Password Rollover
To enable the gradual database password rollover, you must configure the `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` user profile parameter.
``````
```
CREATE PROFILE prof LIMIT
 ...
 PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME 1;
```
``````
  - You specify the rollover time period in days, but you can specify hours if you want. For example, enter 1/24 to specify 1 hour, or 6/24 (or 1/4) to specify 6 hours.
``````````

| Profile Name | PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME | PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME | PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default | 180 | 7 | Minimum: 1/24 (1 hour); Maximum: 7 days |
| ORA_STIG_PROFILE | 60 | 5 | Minimum: 1/24 (1 hour); Maximum: 5 days |
| User Custom Profile | 365 | 90 | Minimum: 1/24 (1 hour); Maximum: 60 days |

  - The minimum value for an active rollover time is 1 hour. The maximum value is 60 days or the lower value of the PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME or PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME parameter. If PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME is set to 0 (zero), then it will be ignored with respect to any limits with PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME. The following table describes these limits:
``````
  - The default setting for PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME is 0 or NULL, which disables it.
``````
  - To find database accounts that are currently in the password rollover process, query the ACCOUNT_STATUS column of the DBA_USERS data dictionary view. The status will be IN ROLLOVER.
  - The password rollover period begins the moment the administrator changes the password for the database account.
## Changing a Password to Begin the Gradual Database Password Rollover Period
After you have set a non-zero `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` value, change the user’s password and update the password with all the applications.
Use the `ALTER USER` statement to provision a new rollover password for the application. After the user’s new password is provisioned in the database, you can update the password on the application servers. You must complete the password updates before the `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` period ends.
You can check the user’s password rollover status by querying the `ACCOUNT_STATUS` column of the `DBA_USERS` data dictionary view. A user account that is within the rollover period will have a status of `IN ROLLOVER`.
``````````
``````````````
```
CREATE PROFILE prof1
LIMIT
PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME 1;
```
  - Create the profile prof1.
````
```
CREATE USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY p1 PROFILE prof1;
```
  - Create the user u1 and associate this user with the prof1 profile.
```
ALTER USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY p2;
```
  - Alter the user’s password.
```
SELECT USERNAME, ACCOUNT_STATUS FROM DBA_USERS WHERE USERNAME = 'U1';
USERNAME ACCOUNT_STATUS
-------- ------------------
U1       OPEN & IN ROLLOVER
```
  - Query the DBA_USER data dictionary view to check the user’s rollover status.
## Changing a Password During the Gradual Database Password Rollover Period
After the rollover period has begun, you can still change the password.
For example, suppose you inadvertently mistype the password. The following procedure enables you to correct the password even though the rollover process has already begun.
````
``````````
```
ALTER USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY p3;
ALTER USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY p3 REPLACE p1;
ALTER USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY p3 REPLACE p2;
```
- To change a password after the rollover process has begun, use the ALTER USER statement, with or without the REPLACE clause. For example, suppose user u1 has the original password p1, p2 is the new password that started the rollover process, and you want to switch to using another password p3 instead of password p2. Any of the following statements work:
After you have changed the password to `p3`, the user can log in using either `p1` or `p3`. An attempt to log in using `p2` returns an `ORA-1017 Invalid Username/Password` error, and is recorded as a failed login attempt. Similarly, after a subsequent password change from `p3` to `p4` during the rollover period, the user can log in using either `p1` or `p4`. Attempts to log in using either `p2` or `p3` will return an `ORA-1017 Invalid Username/Password` error, and are recorded as failed login attempts.
The rollover start time is fixed the first time a user changes their password. The start time is not affected by further password changes during the password rollover period. This design limits the length of time the old password can be used to the `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` period after the password is changed outside of the password rollover period.
## Ending the Password Rollover Period
There are multiple ways in which you can end the password rollover period.
For example, suppose `p1` is the original password for user `u1`, and `p2` is the new password that has been updated to all clients.
  - Let the password rollover period expire on its own. For example, if the password rollover period is 1 day, wait for 1 day and the password rollover period will expire automatically.
```
ALTER USER u1 EXPIRE PASSWORD ROLLOVER PERIOD;
```
  - As either the user or an administrator, execute the following statement to manually end the password rollover period:
  - As an administrator, expire the password by executing the ALTER USER username PASSWORD EXPIRE statement. The next time the user logs in, he or she will be required to change their password.
Beginning with the first connection attempt after the password rollover period expires, Oracle Database drops the earlier password `p1`. Any attempt to login using the old password `p1` returns an `ORA-1017 Invalid Username/Password` error, and is recorded as a failed login attempt. In effect, connections after the rollover period are authenticated with only the new password, and connections that are attempted with the old password are recorded as failed login attempts. The failed login attempts could lock an account after a sufficient number of consecutive logon attempts with the old password.
Connection attempts to read-only database servers after `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` expires will require new password (`p2`). The password change to `p2` will be made effective for all database clients.
## Database Behavior During the Gradual Password Rollover Period
Users can perform their standard password changes and logins during the password rollover period.
The following database behavior is implemented during the rollover period:
- The user can log in to the database using either the new or the old password. This effectively increases the lifetime of the old password by the time set with PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME.
  - An administrator or the user changes his or her own password by using the ALTER USER statement.
  - The user changes his or her own password by using the SQL*Plus password command.
  - The user’s password is programmatically changed when the Oracle Call Interface (Oracle OCI) OCIPasswordChange function is executed.
- Oracle Database does not send any special messages to the database clients that indicate that the user account is in the password rollover period. This design avoids any errors from applications that may not be equipped to handle error and warning messages when a user logs in.
- Too many failed login attempts move the user account into a timed lock state, depending on the value of profile limit PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME. After the timed lock period expires, the state of the password rollover period determines what happens when the user attempts to log in.
``````
- User administrators can perform other password lifecyle related actions as usual, such as ACCOUNT LOCK, ACCOUNT UNLOCK, EXPIRE PASSWORD operations.
````
- The password limits that have been set by the PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX in the user profile continue to be honored during the rollover period. Any password changes during the rollover period are validated against password change history and added into the password change history.
````````
- Expiring a user account does not affect the password rollover status. As with locked accounts, Oracle Database maintains the password verifiers in their current state. The user can log in using either old or new password (p1 or p2). However, after the user successfully changes their password (to p3), the user is allowed to log in only using the newest password (p3). Both the old passwords are treated as expired.
````````
- Oracle Data Pump exports the password hashes (also known as verifiers) for the latest password for user accounts in the password rollover period. For example, if a user u1 has an old password p1 and new password p2, then Oracle Data Pump exports password hashes for password p2 only.
## Database Server Behavior After the Password Rollover Period Ends
Oracle Database performs clean-up operations after the gradual database password rollover period ends.
After the password rollover period expires, only the new password is allowed and the old password stops working. Attempting to use the old password returns an `ORA-1017 Invalid Username/Password` error, and is recorded as a failed login attempt. Connections after the password rollover period will only use the new password, and attempts to use the previous passwords will fail for both read-only and read-write databases. Failed login attempts could lock the user account depending on how many consecutive login attempts have been made to use the old password, based on the `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` limit in the password profile.
## Guideline for Handling Compromised Passwords
If a database account password is suspected of being compromised, then you should change the password immediately.
You can perform this change without going through a password rollover period by using the `ALTER USER` statement in one execution to both change and expire the old password, instead of executing two commands sequentially. This option is preferred over changing the `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` in the associated user profile, because other accounts will then be affected.
Use the following syntax to change and expire the old password:
```
ALTER USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY new_password EXPIRE PASSWORD ROLLOVER PERIOD;
```
## How Gradual Database Password Rollover Works During Oracle Data Pump Exports
When a user is exported while they are in the password rollover period, only the verifier corresponding to their new password is exported.
The verifier that corresponds to their old password is not included in the Oracle Data Pump dump file. After the user is imported, only the new password can be used to authenticate.
## Using Gradual Database Password Rollover in an Oracle Data Guard Environment
In an Oracle Data Guard environment, you must set the `ADG_ACCOUNT_INFO_TRACKING` environment variable to `GLOBAL` to use gradual database password rollover.
```
ADG_ACCOUNT_INFO_TRACKING=GLOBAL
```
Otherwise, any initial logons that are performed on the Oracle Data Guard standby by a user who is using the rolled over password after the `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` expiration will result in an `ORA-16000: database or pluggable database open for read-only access` error.
## Finding Users Who Still Use Their Old Passwords
You can perform a query that makes use of the `AUTHENTICATION_TYPE` field for a `LOGIN` audit record to find users who still use their old passwords.
The unified audit trail can identify which users are still connecting to the database using an old password. The `AUTHENTICATION_TYPE` field for a `LOGON` audit record can show if the old verifier was used. This information enables you to find applications that have not been updated with gradual database password rollover to use the new password. The `LOGON` audit record indicates which application server must be updated.
````
- Connect to the database as a user who has the AUDIT_VIEWER or AUDIT_MGMT role.
```
SELECT DBUSERNAME, AUTHENTICATION_TYPE, OS_USERNAME, USERHOST, EVENT_TIMESTAMP
FROM UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL
WHERE ACTION_NAME='LOGON' AND EVENT_TIMESTAMP > SYSDATE-1
AND REGEXP_LIKE(AUTHENTICATION_TYPE, '(VERIFIER=.*?-OLD)');
```
```
DBUSERNAME    AUTHENTICATION_TYPE                                                                                                                                              OS_USERNAME    USERHOST    EVENT_TIMESTAMP
